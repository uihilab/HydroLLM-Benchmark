0,"INTRODUCTIONQuite literally, hydrology is ‘the science or study of’ (‘logy’ from Latin logia) ‘water’ (‘hydro’ from Greek hudor). However, contemporary hydrology does not study all the properties of water. Modern hydrol-ogy is concerned with the distribution of water on the surface of the earth; its movement over and beneath the surface, and through the atmosphere. This wide-ranging deﬁnition suggests that all water comes under the remit of a hydrologist, while in reality it is the study of fresh water that is of primary concern. The study of the saline water on earth is carried out in oceanography.When studying the distribution and movement of water it is inevitable that the role of human inter-action with it comes into play. Although human needs for water are not the only motivating force in a desire to understand hydrology, they are prob-ably the strongest. This book attempts to integrate the physical processes of hydrology with an under-standing of human interaction with fresh water. The human interaction can take the form of water quan-tity problems (e.g. over-extraction of groundwater) or water quality issues (e.g. disposal of pollutants).Water is among the most essential requisites that nature provides to sustain life for plants, animals and humans. The total quantity of fresh water on earth could satisfy all the needs of the human population if it were evenly distributed and accessible.(Stumm 1986: 201)Although written around 30 years ago, the views expressed by Stumm are still apt today. The real point of Stumm’s statement is that water on earth is not evenly distributed and is not evenly accessible. It is the purpose of hydrology as a pure science to explore these disparities and try to explain them. It is the aim of hydrology as an applied science to take the knowledge of why any disparities exist and try to lessen the impact of them. There is much more to hydrology than just supplying water for human needs (e.g. studying ﬂoods as natural hazards; the investigation of lakes and rivers for ecological habitats), but analysis of this quotation gives good grounds for looking at different approaches to the study of hydrology.The two main pathways to the study of hydrol-ogy come from engineering and geography, particu-larly the earth science side of geography. The earth science approach comes from the study of landforms (geomorphology) and is rooted in a history of explaining the processes that lead to water mov-ing around the earth and to try to understand spa-tial links between the processes. The engineering 1HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE2HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCEapproach tends to be a little more practically based and looks towards ﬁnding solutions to problems posed by water moving (or not moving) around the earth. In reality there are huge areas of overlap between the two and it is often difﬁcult to separate them, particularly when you enter into hydrologi-cal research. At an undergraduate level, however, the difference manifests itself through earth science hydrology being more descriptive (understanding processes) and engineering hydrology being more numerate (quantifying ﬂows). Within the broad discipline of hydrology there are also areas of spe-cialisation. For example, some hydrologists focus on groundwater and this specialised area is known as geohydrology or hydrogeology. In recent decades another area of specialisation has emerged; that of ecohydrology or hydroecology. This is the study of hydrology in relation to the natural aquatic envi-ronment (e.g. rivers and wetlands) and the impor-tant interdependence of water and ecosystems.The approach taken in this book is more towards the earth science side, a reﬂection of the authors’ training and interests, but it is inevita-ble that there is considerable crossover. There are parts of the book that describe numerical tech-niques of fundamental importance to any prac-tising hydrologist from whatever background, and it is hoped that the book can be used by all undergraduate students of hydrology.Throughout the book there are highlighted case studies to illustrate different points made in the text. The case studies are drawn from research projects or different hydrological events around the world and are aimed at reinforcing the text else-where in the same chapter. Where appropriate, there are highlighted worked examples illustrating the use of a particular technique on a real data set.IMPORTANCE OF WATERWater is the most common substance on the surface of the earth, with the oceans covering over 70 per cent of the planet. Water is one of the few substances that can be found in all three states (i.e. gas, liquid and solid) within the earth’s climatic range. The very presence of water in all three forms makes it possible for the earth to have a climate that is habit-able for life forms: water acts as a climate ameliorator through the energy absorbed and released during transformation between the different phases. In addition to lessening climatic extremes the trans-formation of water between gas, liquid and solid phases is vital for the transfer of energy around the globe: moving energy from the equatorial regions towards the poles. The low viscosity of water makes it an extremely efﬁcient transport agent, whether through international shipping or river and canal navigation. These characteristics can be described as the physical properties of water and they are critical for human survival on planet earth.The chemical properties of water are equally impor-tant for our everyday existence. Water is one of the best solvents naturally occurring on the planet. This makes water vital for cleanliness: we use it for washing but also for the disposal of pollutants. The solvent properties of water allow the uptake of vital nutrients from the soil and into plants; this then allows the transfer of the nutrients within a plant’s structure. The ability of water to dissolve gases such as oxygen allows life to be sustained within bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and oceans.The capability of water to support life goes beyond bodies of water; the human body is com-posed of around 60 per cent water. The majority of this water is within cells, but there is a signiﬁcant proportion (around 34 per cent) that moves around the body carrying dissolved chemicals which are vital for sustaining our lives (Ross and Wilson 1981). Our bodies can store up energy reserves that allow us to survive without food for weeks but not more than days without water.There are many other ways that water affects our very being. In places such as Norway, parts of the USA and New Zealand, energy generation for domestic and industrial consumption is through hydro-electric schemes, harnessing the combina-tion of water and gravity in a (by and large) sus-tainable manner. Water plays a large part in the spiritual lives of millions of people. In Christianity, HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE3baptism with water is a powerful symbol of cleans-ing and God offers ‘streams of living water’ to those who believe (John 7:38). In Islam there is washing with water before entering a mosque for prayer. In Hinduism, bathing in the sacred Ganges provides a religious cleansing. Many other religions give water an important role in sacred texts and rituals.Water is important because it underpins our very existence: it is part of our physical, material and spiritual lives. The study of water would therefore also seem to underpin our very existence. Before expanding further on the study of hydrology it is ﬁrst necessary to step back and take a closer look at the properties of water brieﬂy outlined above. Even though water is the most common substance found on the earth’s surface, it is also one of the strangest. Many of these strange properties help to contribute to its importance in sustaining life on earth.Physical and chemical properties of waterA water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom (Figure 1.1). The connection between the atoms is through covalent bonding: the sharing of an electron from each atom to give a stable pair. This is the strongest type of bonding within molecules and is the reason why water is such a robust compound (i.e. it does not break down into hydrogen and oxygen easily). The robustness of the water molecule means that it stays as a water molecule within our atmosphere because there is not enough energy available to break the covalent bonds and create separate oxygen and hydrogen molecules.Figure 1.1 shows us that the hydrogen atoms are not arranged around the oxygen atom in a straight line. There is an angle of approximately 105° (i.e. a little larger than a right angle) between the hydro-gen atoms. The hydrogen atoms have a positive charge, which means that they repulse each other, but at the same time there are two non-bonding electron pairs on the oxygen atom that also repulse the hydrogen atoms. This leads to the molecular structure shown in Figure 1.1. A water molecule can be described as bipolar, which means that there is a positive and negative side to the molecule. This polarity is an important property of water as it leads to the bonding between molecules of water: hydro-gen bonding. The positive side of the molecule (i.e. the hydrogen side) is attracted to the negative side (i.e. the oxygen atom) of another molecule and a weak hydrogen bond is formed (Figure 1.2). The weakness of this bond means that it can be broken

4HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCEwith the application of some force and the water molecules separate, forming water in a gaseous state (water vapour). Although this sounds easy, it actu-ally takes a lot of energy to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. This leads to a high speciﬁc heat capacity whereby a large amount of energy is absorbed by the water to cause a small rise in energy.The lack of rigidity in the hydrogen bonds between liquid water molecules gives it two more important properties: a low viscosity and the ability to act as an effective solvent. Low viscosity comes from water molecules not being so tightly bound together that they cannot separate when a force is applied to them. This makes water an extremely efﬁcient transport mechanism. When a ship applies force to the water molecules they move aside to let it pass! The ability to act as an efﬁcient sol-vent comes through water molecules disassociating from each other and being able to surround charged compounds contained within them. As described earlier, the ability of water to act as an efﬁcient sol-vent allows us to use it for washing and the disposal of pollutants, and also allows nutrients to pass from the soil to a plant.In water’s solid state (i.e. ice) the hydrogen bonds become rigid and a three-dimensional crystalline structure forms. An unusual prop-erty of water is that the solid form has a lower density than the liquid form, something that is rare in other compounds. This property has pro-found implications for the world we live in as it means that ice ﬂoats on water. More importantly for aquatic life, it means that water freezes from the top down rather than the other way around. If water froze from the bottom up, then aquatic ﬂora and fauna would be forced upwards as the water froze and eventually end up stranded on the surface of a pond, river or sea. As it is, the ﬂora and fauna are able to survive underneath the ice in liquid water. The maximum density of water actu-ally occurs at around 4 °C (see Figure 1.3) so that still bodies of water such as lakes and ponds will display thermal stratiﬁcation, with water close to 4 °C sinking to the bottom.Water requires a large amount of energy to heat it up. This can be assessed through the speciﬁc heat capacity, which is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by a single degree. Water has a high speciﬁc heat capacity relative to other substances (Table 1.1). It requires 4,200 joules of energy to raise the tempera-ture of 1 kilogram of liquid water (approximately 1 litre) by a single degree. In contrast dry soil has a speciﬁc heat capacity of around 1.1 kJ/kg/K (it varies according to mineral make up and organic content) and alcohol 0.7 kJ/kg/K. Heating causes the movement of water molecules and that move-ment requires the breaking of the hydrogen bonds linking them. The large amount of energy required to break the hydrogen bonds in water gives it such a high speciﬁc heat capacity.We can see evidence of water’s high speciﬁc heat capacity in bathing waters away from the trop-ics. It is common for sea temperatures to be much lower than air temperatures in high summer since the water is absorbing all the solar radiation and heating up very slowly. In contrast the water tem-perature also decreases slowly, leading to the sea often being warmer than the air during autumn and winter. As the water cools down it starts to release the energy that it absorbed as it heated up. Consequently for every drop in temperature of 1 °C a single kilogram of water releases 4.2 kJ of energy Figure 1.3 The density of water with temperature. The broken line shows the maximum density of water at 3.98 °C.

into the atmosphere. It is this that makes water a climate ameliorator. During the summer months a water body will absorb large amounts of energy as it slowly warms up; in an area without a water body, that energy would heat the earth much quicker (i.e. dry soil in Table 1.1) and consequently air tempera-tures would be higher. In the winter the energy is slowly released from the water as it cools down and is available for heating the atmosphere nearby. This is why a maritime climate has cooler summers, but warmer winters, than a continental climate.The energy required to break hydrogen bonds is also the mechanism by which large amounts of energy are transported away from the hot equa-torial regions towards the cooler poles. As water evaporates, the hydrogen bonds between liquid molecules are broken. This requires a large amount of energy. The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed into another form. In this case the energy absorbed by the water particles while breaking the hydrogen bonds is transformed into latent heat that is then released as sensible heat as the water precipitates (i.e. returns to a liquid form). In the meantime the water has often moved considerable distances in weather systems, taking the latent energy with it. It is estimated that water movement accounts for 70 per cent of lateral global energy transport through latent heat transfer (Mauser and Schädlich 1998), also known as advective energy.Water acts as a climate ameliorator in one other way: water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas. Radiation direct from the sun (short-wave radia-tion) passes straight through the atmosphere and may be then absorbed by the earth’s surface. This energy is normally re-radiated back from the earth’s surface in a different form (long-wave radiation). The long-wave radiation is absorbed by the gaseous water molecules and consequently does not escape the atmosphere. This leads to the gradual warm-ing of the earth–atmosphere system as there is an imbalance between the incoming and outgoing radiation. It is the presence of water vapour in our atmosphere (and other gases such as carbon diox-ide and methane) that has allowed the planet to be warm enough to support all of the present life forms that exist.Figure 1.4 shows the phase transitions of water and the name of the corresponding process. While some of these processes have already been men-tioned, it is important to be familiar with all of them. One that is particularly relevant for the next chapter is desublimation or deposition. This is where ice forms directly from water vapour. It is also important to note that at normal atmo-spheric pressure and at temperatures between 0 °C and 100 °C, liquid water is in a stable state, as is water vapour above temperatures of 100 °C, and ice below 0 °C. However water can also exist in metastable states, and importantly these often occur in the atmosphere. Between temperatures of 0 °C and as low as −40 °C, metastable water can exist in liquid form, known as supercooled water. Equally, metastable water vapour can exist alongside stable ice and metastable supercooled water. When supercooled liquid water comes into contact with ice, instantaneous freezing occurs. Note that some meteorologists use sublimation to mean both a phase transformation from solid to gas, and also the reverse process. To avoid confu-sion we will use the equivalent terms deposition and desublimation to refer to the process of a gas becoming a solid without the intermediate liquid phase.The catchment or river basinIn studying hydrology the most common spa-tial unit of consideration is the catchment or Table 1.1 Speciﬁc heat capacity of various substancesSubstanceSpeciﬁc heat capacity (kJ/kg/K)Water4.2Dry soil1.1Ethanol (alcohol)0.7Iron0.446HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE
river basin. This can be deﬁned as the area of land from which water ﬂows towards a river and then in that river to the sea. The terminology suggests that the area is analogous to a basin where all water moves towards a central point (i.e. the plug hole of a basin, or in this case, the river mouth). The common denominator of any point in a catchment is that wherever rain falls, it will end up in the same place: where the river meets the sea (unless lost through evaporation). A catchment may range in size from a matter of hectares to millions of square kilometres, and all catchments are, in reality, made up of a set of nested sub-catchments.A river basin can be deﬁned in terms of its topography through the assumption that all water falling on the surface ﬂows downhill. In this way a catchment boundary (or divide) can be drawn (catchment delineation) (as in Figure 1.5) which deﬁnes the actual catchment area for a river basin. In some parts of the world a river basin is also referred to as a watershed – this word stems from the fact that at the catchment boundary water is either ‘shed’ into one basin or an adjacent basin. Strictly speaking therefore ‘watershed’ refers to the catchment boundary or divide. The assump-tion that all water ﬂows downhill to the river is not always correct, especially where the underlying geology of a catchment is complicated. It is pos-sible for water to ﬂow as groundwater into another catchment area, creating a problem for the deﬁni-tion of ‘catchment area’. This means that the surface water catchment and the groundwater catchment are not necessarily the same (Figure 1.6). These ICE(solid)WATER(liquid)WATER VAPOUR(gas)Energy adsorbed

8HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCEproblems aside, the catchment does provide an important spatial unit for hydrologists to consider how water is moving about and is distributed at a certain time.THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLEAs a starting point for the study of hydrology it is useful to consider the hydrological cycle. This is a conceptual model of how water moves around between the earth and atmosphere in dif-ferent states as a gas, liquid or solid. As with any conceptual model it contains many gross sim-pliﬁcations; these are discussed in this section. There are different scales at which the hydro-logical cycle can be viewed, but it is helpful to start at the large global scale and then move to the smaller hydrological unit of a river basin or catchment.The global hydrological cycleTable 1.2 sets out an estimate for the amount of water held on the earth at a single time. These ﬁgures are extremely hard to estimate accurately. Estimates cited in Gleick (1993) show a range in total from 1.36 to 1.45 thousand million (or US billion) cubic kilometres of water. The vast majority of this is contained in the oceans and seas. If you were to count groundwater less than 1km in depth as ‘available’ and discount snow and ice, then the total percentage of water available for human consumption is around 0.27 per cent. Although this sounds very little it works out at about 146 million litres of water per person per day (assuming a world population of 7 billion); hence the ease with which Stumm (1986) was able to state that there is enough to satisfy all human needs.Figure 1.7 shows the movement of water around the earth–atmosphere system and is a representation of the global hydrological cycle. The cycle consists of evaporation of liquid water into water vapour that is moved around the atmo-sphere. At some stage the water vapour condenses into a liquid (or solid) again and falls to the sur-face as precipitation. The oceans evaporate more water than they receive as precipitation, while the opposite is true over the continents. The dif-ference between precipitation and evaporation in the terrestrial zone is runoff, water moving over or under the surface towards the oceans, which completes the hydrological cycle. As can be seen Table 1.2 Estimated volumes of water held at the earth’s surfaceVolume (×103 km3)Percentage of totalOceans and seas1,338,00096.54Ice caps and glaciers24,0641.74Groundwater23,4001.69Permafrost3000.022Lakes1760.013Soil16.50.001Atmosphere12.90.0009Marsh/wetlands11.50.0008Rivers2.120.00015Biota1.120.00008Total1,385,984100.00Source: Data from Shiklomanov and Sokolov (1983)HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE9
total precipitation is partitioned towards differ-ent hydrological processes in differing amounts depending on climate. In temperate climates (i.e. non-tropical or polar) around one third of precipitation becomes evaporation, one third surface runoff and the ﬁnal third as groundwa-ter recharge. In arid and semi-arid regions the proportion of evaporation is much greater, at the expense of groundwater recharge.With the advent of satellite monitoring of the earth’s surface in the past 40 years it is now possible to gather information on the global distribution in Figure 1.7, where the width of the arrows is proportional to the volume, the vast majority of evaporation and precipitation occurs over the oceans. Ironically this means that the terrestrial zone, which is of greatest concern to hydrologists, is actually rather insigniﬁcant in global terms.The processes shown in Figure 1.7 (evapora-tion, precipitation and runoff) are the funda-mental processes of concern in hydrology. The ﬁgures given in the diagram are global totals, but they vary enormously around the globe. This is illustrated in Figure 1.8 which shows how Figure 1.7 The global hydrological cycle. The numbers represent estimates on the total amount of water (km3) in each process per annum.

of these three processes and hence view how the hydrological cycle varies around the world.The global distribution of freshwater resourcesThe ﬁgure given above of 146 million litres of fresh water per person per year is extremely misleading, as the distribution of available water around the globe varies enormously. The concept of avail-able water considers not only the distribution of rainfall but also population. Table 1.3 gives some indication of those countries that could be consid-ered water-rich and water-poor in terms of available water. Even this is misleading as a country such as Australia is so large that the high rainfall received in the tropical north-west compensates for the extreme lack of rainfall elsewhere; hence it is con-sidered water-rich. The use of rainfall alone is also misleading as it does not consider the importation of water passing across borders, through rivers and groundwater movement.Table 1.3 gives the amount of available water for various countries, but this takes no account for Figure 1.8 Proportion of total precipitation that returns to evaporation, surface runoff or groundwater recharge in three different climate zones.Source: UNESCO (2006)

the amount of water abstracted for actual usage. Figure 1.8 shows the water abstraction per capita for all of the OECD countries. This shows that the USA, Canada and Australia are very high water-users, reﬂecting a very large amount of water used for agricultural and industrial production. The largest water user is the USA with 1,730m3 per capita per annum, which is still only 1 per cent of the 146 million litres per capita per annum derived from the Stumm quote. Australia as a high water-user has run into enormous difﬁculties in the years 2005–2007 with severe drought, limiting water availability for domestic and agricultural users. In a situation like this the way that water is allocated (see Chapter 11) literally becomes a matter of life and death, and many economic livelihoods depend on equitable allocation of a scarce water resource.To try and overcome some of the difﬁculties in interpreting the data in Figure 1.7 and Table 1.2, hydrologists often work at a scale of more relevance to the physical processes occurring. This is frequently the water basin or catchment scale (Figure 1.5).The catchment hydrological cycleAt a smaller scale it is possible to view the catch-ment hydrological cycle as a more in-depth concep-tual model of the hydrological processes operating. Figure 1.10 shows an adaptation of the global hydrological cycle to show the processes operating within a catchment. In Figure 1.10 there are still essentially three processes operating (evaporation, precipitation and runoff), but it is possible to sub-divide each into different sub-processes. Evapora-tion is a mixture of open water evaporation (i.e. from rivers and lakes); evaporation from the soil; evaporation from plant surfaces; interception; and transpiration from plants. Precipitation can be in the form of snowfall, hail, rainfall or some mixture of the three (sleet). Interception of precipitation by plants makes the water available for evaporation again before it even reaches the soil surface. Build-ings and impervious surfaces similarly intercept precipitation and what proportion is evaporated or becomes runoff. The broad term ‘runoff’ incor-porates the movement of liquid water above and Table 1.3 Annual renewable water resources per capita (2013 ﬁgures) of the seven water resource-richest and poorest countries (and other selected countries).

HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE13below the surface of the earth. The movement of water below the surface necessitates an understand-ing of inﬁltration into the soil and how the water moves in the unsaturated zone (throughﬂow) and in the saturated zone (groundwater ﬂow). All of these processes and sub-processes are dealt with in detail in later chapters; what is important to realise at this stage is that it is part of one continuous cycle that moves water around the globe and that they may all be operating at different times within a river basin.THE WATER BALANCE EQUATIONIn the previous section it was stated that the hydro-logical cycle is a conceptual model representing our understanding of which processes are operat-ing within an overall earth–atmosphere system. It is also possible to represent this in the form of an equation, which is normally termed the water balance equation. The water balance equation is a mathematical description of the hydrological processes operating within a given timeframe and incorporates principles of mass and energy continu-ity. In this way the hydrological cycle is deﬁned as a closed system whereby there is no mass or energy created or lost within it. The mass of concern in this case is water.There are numerous ways of representing the water balance equation, but Equation 1.1 shows it in its most fundamental form.P ± E ± ΔS ± Q = 0 (1.1)where P is precipitation; E is evaporation; ΔS is the change in storage and Q is runoff. Runoff is normally given the notation of Q to distinguish it from rainfall which is often given the symbol R and frequently forms the major component of precipitation. The ± terminology in Equation 1.1 represents the fact that each term can be either posi-tive or negative depending on which way you view it – for example, precipitation is a gain (positive) to the earth but a loss (negative) to the atmosphere. As most hydrology is concerned with water on or about the earth’s surface it is customary to consider the terms as positive when they represent a gain to the earth.If we think about the water balance equation from the perspective of trying to quantify ﬂow in a river (Q) then we can re-arrange it as shown in Equation 1.2.Q = P – E – ΔS (1.2)In Equations 1.1 and 1.2 the change in storage term can be either positive or negative, as water can be released from storage (negative) or absorbed into storage (positive).The terms in the water balance equation can be recognised as a series of ﬂuxes and stores. A ﬂux is a rate of ﬂow of some quantity (Goudie et al. 1994): in the case of hydrology the quantity is water. The water balance equation assesses the relative ﬂux of water to and from the surface with a storage term also incorporated. A large part of hydrology is involved in measuring or estimating the amount of water involved in this ﬂux transfer and storage of water.Precipitation in the water balance equation rep-resents the main input of water to a surface (e.g. a catchment). As explained on p. 11, precipitation is a ﬂux of both rainfall and snowfall. Evapora-tion as a ﬂux includes that from open water bodies (lakes, ponds, rivers), the soil surface and vegeta-tion (including both interception and transpiration from plants). The storage term includes soil mois-ture, deep groundwater, water in lakes, glaciers, and seasonal snow cover. The runoff ﬂux is also explained on p. 11. In essence it is the movement of liquid water above and below the surface of the earth.The water balance equation is probably the clos-est that hydrology comes to having a fundamen-tal theory underlying it as a science, and hence almost all hydrological study is based around it. Field catchment studies are frequently trying to measure the different components of the equation 14HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCEin order to assess others. Nearly all hydrological models attempt to solve the equation for a given time span – for example, by knowing the amount of rainfall for a given area and estimating the amount of evaporation and change in storage it is possible to calculate the amount of runoff that might be expected.Despite its position as a fundamental hydrologi-cal theory there is still considerable uncertainty about the application of the water balance equa-tion. It is not an uncertainty about the equation itself but rather about how it may be applied. The problem is that all of the processes occur at a spa-tial and temporal scale (i.e. they operate over a period of time and within a certain area) that may not coincide with the scale at which we make our measurement or estimation. It is this issue of scale that makes hydrology appear an imprecise science and it will be discussed further in the remaining chapters of this book. In the next section we will consider an important aspect of temporal scale that will underpin much of the later discussion around understanding and quantifying processes such as rainfall and runoff.MAGNITUDE–FREQUENCY–DURATION RELATIONSHIPSAll components of the hydrological cycle vary over time. For example, ﬂow in a stream might vary sea-sonally, but also over the short term (e.g. hours) in response to a rainfall event. Describing and understanding how processes vary temporally is an important aspect of hydrology, and plotting the fre-quency distribution of a process can reveal impor-tant information. For example, in Figure 1.11, the frequency distribution of daily mean river ﬂows

Occasionally (about 5 per cent of the time) ﬂows are less than this, and even more occasionally ﬂows are higher, and much higher, than this. The highest ﬂow of nearly 12 m3/s, only on one day of the 38-year record, and ﬂows exceeding 9 m3/s occur only on  7 days, or 0.05 per cent of the time. What this illustrates is a fundamental relationship between magnitude and frequency. High-magnitude events occur very infrequently, in other words, extreme events are rare. The occurrence of high magni-tude, low frequency events is also responsible for the asymmetry of the distribution in Figure 1.11. Whereas a normal distribution would have ﬂows symmetrically distributed about the mean, ﬂow (and rainfall) are positively skewed, often with a long tail of higher values. As a result the median is often much less than the mean.Understanding magnitude–frequency relation-ships is an important aspect of hydrology, particu-larly in relation to ﬂood hydrology, and we will cover this in a little more detail in Chapter 9. What is important to remember now, is that regardless of the type of hydrological process (e.g. precipitation, ﬂow), each measurement or estimation of magni-tude is associated with a frequency which reﬂects how commonly or rarely events of that magnitude occur. This means that the frequency also tells us something about the likelihood of occurrence. This is also referred to as the probability of occurrence and can be expressed in a decimal (or percentage) form where 1 (or 100 per cent) would be certainty of occurrence, and 0 would be certainty of non-occurrence. For example if a weather report sug-gests an 80 per cent chance of rain, this means that under similar meteorological conditions in the past it has rained 8 out of 10 times. Implicit in this is that probability is calculated from the relative frequency:pnN= (1.3)wherep = probabilityn = number of occurrencesN = total number of observationsAs we will see in Chapter 9, the inverse of the probability is the recurrence interval. So for example, if we know that a particular ﬂow has a probability of 1 per cent (p = 0.01), then the recurrence interval is 1/0.01 = 100 years. So the event that has a 1 per cent chance of occurring is also the 1 in 100 year event. In the past this was known as the ‘return period’ but the term recurrence interval is now preferred because the concept of a ‘return period’ is frequently misun-derstood. For example, if a 1 in 100 year ﬂood was experienced last year this does not mean another similarly sized ﬂood will not occur for another 100 years. In fact, the chances of experiencing a similar ﬂood in the next year remain the same. What the ‘return period’ or recurrence interval really refers to is the average time between events of the same magnitude – but averaged over a long period.So, we have seen how magnitude and frequency are related, and how these can tell us something about event rarity and the probability of occurrence. We will now turn to another important descriptor in hydrology, that of duration. Fundamental rela-tionships between magnitude and frequency also apply when we consider duration. For example, we can distinguish between the total depth of rain fall-ing in 1 hour, several hours, or a 24-hour period. So for a particular location, we would have differ-ent estimates of magnitude (depth) depending on both duration and recurrence interval (frequency) (Figure 1.12).Magnitude–frequency–duration relationships are characteristic of all the processes we will be covering in this book, but are especially important in relation to rainfall and river ﬂow. The reason for dealing with these fundamentals here is to sig-nal the importance of being aware of these three dimensions and their interrelationships.16HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE
by vegetation and the land surface, introducing the storage term from the water balance equation, particularly in relation to the role of water stored as snow and ice. Chapters 5 and 6 look at the two other major storages; that under the earth’s surface as groundwater (Chapter 5) and that within the soil (Chapter 6). Even though water has to pass through the soil before becoming groundwater, we deal with groundwater ﬁrst because the fundamental prin-ciples governing ﬂow in groundwater (saturated ﬂow) are a little more straightforward than ﬂow in the soil under unsaturated conditions. Chapter 7 is concerned with the runoff processes that lead to water ﬂowing down a channel in a stream or river.Each of Chapters 2–7 starts with a detailed description of the process under review in the 020406080100120140

By and large, water management is concerned with issues of water quantity (e.g. ﬂoods, droughts, water supply and distribution) and water quality (e.g. drinking water, aquatic ecosystem health). These two management concerns form the basis for discussion within the book. The ﬁrst section focuses on components of the hydrological cycle. Precipitation is dealt with in Chapter 2, followed by evaporation in Chapter 3, each of these being a key term in the water balance equation. Chapter 4 considers what happens to the water intercepted HYDROLOGY AS A SCIENCE172 Describe how the hydrological cycle varies around the globe.3 How may water-poor countries over-come the lack of water resources within their borders?4 Using examples, explain the concept of a magnitude–frequency–duration relationship and its importance in hydrology.WEBSITESA warning: although it is often easy to access infor-mation via the internet you should always be care-ful in utilising it.

They then move on to contain a section on how it is possible to measure the process, fol-lowed by a section on how it may be estimated. In reality it is not always possible to separate between measurement and estimation as many techniques contain an element of both within them, something that is pointed out in various places within these chapters. Chapters 2–7 ﬁnish with a discussion on how the particular process described has relevance to water quantity and quality.Chapters 8 and 9 move away from descriptions of processes and look at the methods available to ﬁrstly measure channel ﬂow (Chapter 8) and then how to analyse these streamﬂow records (Chapter 9). This is one of the main tasks within hydrology and three particular techniques are described: hydrograph analysis (including the unit hydrograph), ﬂow dura-tion curves and frequency analysis. The latter mostly concentrates on ﬂood frequency analysis, although there is a short description of how the techniques can be applied to low ﬂows. The chapter also has sections on hydrological modelling and combining ecology and hydrology for instream ﬂow analysis.Chapter 10 is concerned with water quality in the fresh water environment. This chapter has a description of major water quality parameters, mea-surement techniques and some strategies used to control water quality.The ﬁnal chapter takes an integrated approach to look at different issues of change that affect hydrology (Chapter 11). These range from water resource man-agement and a changing legislative framework to cli-mate and land use change. These issues are discussed with reference to research studies investigating the different themes. It is intended as a way of capping off the fundamentals of hydrology by looking at real issues facing hydrology in the twenty-ﬁrst century.ESSAY QUESTIONS1 Discuss the nature of water’s physical properties and how important these are in determining the natural climate of the earth."
1,"PRECIPITATION AS A PROCESSPrecipitation is the release of water from the atmo-sphere to reach the surface of the earth. The term ‘precipitation’ covers all forms of water being released by the atmosphere, including snow, hail, sleet and rainfall. It is the major input of water to a river catchment area and as such needs careful assessment in any hydrological study. Although rainfall is relatively straightforward to measure (other forms of precipitation are more difﬁcult) it is notoriously difﬁcult to measure accurately and, to compound the problem, is also extremely variable within a catchment area.Understanding the atmosphereThe atmosphere around is comprised of the gases we breathe (principally nitrogen [~78 per cent], but also oxygen [~21 per cent]), and water vapour. Gravity concentrates these gases closer to the earth’s surface, which is why atmospheric pressure decreases as you ascend. For example, at 5,500 m, the pressure is half that of the surface, which is why an aircraft cabin needs to be pressurised. The atmospheric pressure measured on the surface by a barometer represents the pressure exerted by all these gases upon the earth’s surface. Although the SI unit of pressure is newtons per square metre (Nm−2), commonly named the pascal (Pa; 1 Pa = 1 Nm−2), LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of the types of precipitation, the fundamental process of precipitation formation and the different precipitation mechanisms. /H17039A knowledge of the techniques for measuring precipitation (rainfall and snow). /H17039An appreciation of the associated errors in measuring precipitation. /H17039A knowledge of how to analyse rainfall data spatially and for intensity/duration of a storm. /H17039A knowledge of some of the methods used to estimate rainfall at the large scale.2PRECIPITATION20PRECIPITATIONClausius-Claperon relation. So the vapour pressure (often denoted as e) at any particular temperature cannot exceed a maximum (denoted as esat), known as the saturated vapour pressure. The saturation vapour pressure curve represents absolute humid-ity at each temperature, and at this temperature, water vapour starts to condense, forming droplets of water. For this reason it is also known as the dew point temperature (or the frost point temperature if the temperature is less than 0 °C). Note that in the description above we said the maximum water vapour that can normally be held, in some cases this can be exceeded, which would be described as pressure is typically reported in millibars (mbar or mb) or hectopascals (hPa) (one standard atmo-sphere = 1,013.2 mb = 1,013.2 Pa). Water vapour typically accounts for a very small proportion of total air pressure (<0.3 per cent) (Ward and Rob-inson 2000).We can simplify the composition of air in the atmosphere into two parts – water vapour, and dry air (being all the other gases), and moist air is there-fore the sum of these components. The maximum amount of water vapour that can normally be held in air is a function of temperature and is shown by the curve in Figure 2.1, sometimes called the

Note that the saturation vapour pressure curve over ice is lower.PRECIPITATION21whereP = atmospheric pressure (kPa)Ta = air temperature (K)ρa = mass density of air (kg/m3)Ra = gas constant (0.288)This means when a parcel of air moves upwards in the atmosphere to an area of lower pressure, it expands (density decreases) and cools. The cooling referred to here has nothing to do with a reduction in heat input (like the effect of switching off a stove plate), it occurs simply because of the change in pressure and density. This is known as adiabatic cool-ing and is fundamentally important in the precipi-tation formation process. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) quantiﬁes this reduction in temperature as an air mass moves upwards, and is approximately 9.8 °C per km. This would apply if the air was dry, but if it is saturated, then the slower saturated adia-batic lapse rate (SALR) applies, because latent heat from the condensation process is released which off-sets the cooling process. The SALR can be as much as half the DALR, but its precise value depends on prevailing air pressure and temperature. In addition to the adiabatic lapse rates there is also the environ-mental lapse rate (ELR). This is related to the more conventional understanding of how temperature decreases the further you are away from a radiating body (the earth), and is equivalent to about 6 °C per km, but does vary.PRECIPITATION FORMATIONAs we have seen above, the ability of air to hold water vapour is temperature dependent: the cooler the air the less water vapour is retained. If a body of warm, moist air is cooled then it will become satu-rated with water vapour and eventually the water vapour will condense into liquid or solid water (i.e. cloud droplets or ice crystals). The water will not condense spontaneously however; there need to be minute particles present in the atmosphere, called condensation nuclei, upon which the cloud drop-lets or ice crystals form. The cloud droplets or ice supersaturated conditions. Superstaturation beyond 1 or 2 per cent in the atmosphere is very rare.While the solid line in Figure 2.1 represents the saturation vapour pressure over water, the dotted line represents the saturation vapour pressure over ice. The reason for this difference is that it is easier for water molecules to escape from the surface of liquid water than it is from solid water (ice). At temperatures below the frost point temperature, deposition (or desublimation) occurs where ice forms directly from water vapour without the intermedi-ate phase of liquid water; this is how hoar frost forms.Vapour pressure is a reﬂection of the concentra-tion of water vapour molecules in a volume of air – effectively a density which is measured as the mass of water vapour molecules (usually g) per unit mass of air (usually kg). Expressing the amount of water vapour in this way is known as the speciﬁc humidity. Look at the difference between the vapour pressure at 30 °C and 20 °C in Figure 2.1. These vapour pressures correspond to 26 g water vapour per kg of air and 15 g of water vapour per kg of air, respec-tively. In other words, raising the temperature by 10 °C means that an extra 11 g of water can be absorbed in the air, with a corresponding increase in the vapour pressure. Similarly, if the air was saturated at 30 °C, and the temperature suddenly dropped to 20 °C, 11 g of water vapour would con-dense as droplets. The latter example explains why droplets of water form on a glass ﬁlled with a cold liquid, when it is brought out into the warmth of a summer’s day.The Ideal Gas Law (Equation 2.1) tells us that there are fundamental relationships between the pressure and volume of a gas and temperature, and shows that the ratio between pressure on the one hand and the product of temperature and density on the other is constant. This means that if pressure is decreased, then so must be the product of tem-perature and pressure, in order to retain the same constant:PTRaaa⋅=ρ (2.1)22PRECIPITATION3 growth of the cloud droplets/ice crystals4 a supply of moisture to continue the process.Atmospheric coolingCooling of the atmosphere may take place through several different mechanisms occurring indepen-dently or simultaneously. The most common form of cooling is from the uplift of air through the atmosphere. As described earlier, when air rises upwards into an area of lower pressure, it expands and cools as a consequence. The cooler tempera-ture leads to less water vapour being retained by the air and conditions becoming favourable for condensation. The elevation at which this hap-pens in the atmosphere is known as the condensa-tion level. Think back to when you have seen the crystals that form on condensation nuclei are nor-mally too small to fall to the surface as precipita-tion; they need to grow in order to have enough mass to fall. Their mass acting under gravity results in a downward force, which is also subject to air resistance (or drag forces). When the downward force equals the drag force, the drop reaches ter-minal velocity. These droplets or ice particles need also overcome any uplifting forces within a cloud in order to fall. Figure 2.2 shows the relative sizes of condensation nuclei, cloud drops and rain drops. So there are three conditions that need to be met prior to precipitation forming, and a further condition that needs to be met to sustain the process:1 cooling of the atmosphere2 condensation onto nuclei

Interestingly, this approach was ﬁrst noticed through the discovery of extra heavy rainfall occurring over a paper mill in South Africa that was emitting potassium chloride from its chimney stack (Mather 1991). Countries in the Middle East are funding signiﬁcant research programs in cloud seeding, as is China where it is being used to generate rain to combat urban smog.Cloud droplet and ice particle growthCloud droplets or ice crystals formed around con-densation nuclei are normally too small to fall directly to the ground; that is, the forces from the upward draught within a cloud are greater than the gravitational forces pulling the microscopic drop-let downwards. In order to overcome the upward draughts it is necessary for the droplets to grow from an initial size of 1 micron to around 3,000 microns (3 mm). The vapour pressure difference between a cloud droplet and the surrounding air will cause it to grow through condensation, albeit rather slowly. When there are ice particles, rather than cloud droplets, the vapour pressure difference with the surrounding air becomes greater and the water vapour desublimates onto the ice particles. Desublimation occurs more quickly than conden-sation onto a cloud droplet, but is still a slow pro-cess. Droplets are also subject to evaporation and may undergo several evaporation-condensation cycles, or in the case of ice particles, evaporation- desublimation cycles. The main mechanism by which drops grow within a cloud is through collision and coalescence: two drops collide and join together (coalesce) to form a larger droplet that may then collide with many more before falling towards the surface as rainfall or another form of precipitation. Larger droplets are more efﬁcient in incorporating smaller droplets because they fall through the cloud more quickly, sweeping through a larger volume of the cloud; the deeper the cloud, the greater the sky ﬁlled with ﬂuffy white clouds where their bases end abruptly and in what seems a straight line in the sky – this is the condensation level. The actual uplift of air may be caused by heating from the earth’s surface (leading to convective precipi-tation), an air mass being forced to rise over an obstruction such as a mountain range (this leads to orographic precipitation), or from a low pressure weather system where the air is constantly being forced upwards (this leads to cyclonic precipita-tion). Other mechanisms whereby the atmosphere cools include a warm air mass meeting a cooler air mass, and the warm air meeting a cooler object such as the sea or land (frontal precipitation).Condensation nucleiCondensation nuclei are minute particles ﬂoating in the atmosphere (aerosols) which provide a surface for the water vapour to condense into liquid water upon. They are commonly less than a micron (1 micron = one-millionth of a metre or one-thousandth of a millimetre, 1 µm) in diameter (Figure 2.2). There are many different substances that make condensa-tion nuclei, including small dust particles, sea salts and smoke particles. If condensation nuclei are not present, this is when air can become supersaturated. More often than not though, these aerosols are pres-ent and enable condensation of water vapour to microscopic cloud droplets.Research into generating artiﬁcial rainfall has concentrated on the provision of condensation nuclei into clouds, a technique called cloud seed-ing. During the 1950s and 1960s much effort was expended in using silver iodide particles, dropped from planes, to act as condensation nuclei. How-ever, more recent work has suggested that other salts such as potassium chloride are better nuclei. There is much controversy over the value of cloud seeding. Some studies support its effectiveness (e.g. Gagin and Neumann 1981; Ben-Zvi 1988); other authors query the results (e.g. Rangno and Hobbs 1995), while others suggest that it only works in certain atmospheric conditions and with certain cloud types (e.g. Changnon et al. 1995). More 24PRECIPITATIONIn warm clouds, the predominant mechanism for droplet growth is by collision and coalescence (see lower right of Figure 2.3). When droplets are large enough to overcome the updraught (or updraft), they will fall as rain. Between temperatures of 0 °C and as low as −40 °C, very tiny cloud droplets may not freeze, but remain as water in a supercooled state. For this to happen, no impurities should be present in the water, and neither must there be any pre-existing ice crystals. Where condensation nuclei are not present, signiﬁcant supercooling in clouds can be quite common. Mixed clouds may therefore comprise both ice particles and super-cooled cloud droplets at temperatures between 0 °C and −40 °C (Figure 2.3).size of drop that is formed (Sitch and Drake 2014). When ice particles grow by collision, this is called aggregation, but is a very slow process.At this point it is useful to distinguish between three types of clouds: warm, cold, and mixed clouds. Cold clouds occur at high altitudes where tem-peratures are less than −40 °C, and are comprised exclusively of ice particles. In contrast, warm clouds occur at lower altitudes where the temperature is greater than 0 °C and are made up of only cloud droplets (i.e. liquid water). As the name suggests, mixed clouds are somewhere between the cold and warm and have a mixture of ice and cloud particles. In mid-latitude regions of the world, mixed clouds are the most common type.

As a droplet is moved around a cloud it may freeze and thaw several times, leading to different types of precipitation (see Table 2.1).HailHail stones are typically around 5 mm, spherical, sometimes irregular in shape and comprise of ice. Larger hail stones (sometimes the size of golf balls) occur occasionally, and although very rare, even larger (>15 cm in diameter) have been recorded. Hail stones start as ice particles in the highest part of very large storm clouds (cumulonimbus clouds), the lower base of which are ﬁlled with supercooled water droplets. Up and down draughts in these huge clouds can be signiﬁcant and when an ice par-ticle is thrust downwards towards the base of the cloud and collides with supercooled water droplets, they freeze immediately, adding more ice. A cross-section through a typical hailstone shows alternat-ing layers of clear and translucent ice. Where ice is opaque, freezing happened instantaneously, trap-ping air. Where it is clear, freezing happened more slowly (Sumner 1988). Slower freezing occurs at the tops of cumulonimbus clouds. Because of the violent up and down draughts in these very large cumulonimbus clouds, hail stones can circulate sev-eral times, before their increasing mass overcomes the up draught and they fall as hail stones. If con-ditions are warmer below the cloud base they may melt and fall as rain. Hail can cause serious damage to infrastructure and agriculture, and in the United States hail storms cause losses of the order of $1 bil-lion per year (see National Storm Damage Centre https://stormdamagecenter.org/hail-storm.php).Dew and frostThe same process of condensation occurs in dew-fall, only in this case the water vapour condenses into liquid water (dew) after coming into contact with a cold surface. In humid-temperate countries, dew is a common occurrence in autumn/fall when the air at night is still warm but vegetation and Another important mechanism by which drop-lets grow sufﬁciently large to fall as precipitation is known as the Bergeron-Findeisen process, sometimes known as the cold cloud process as it can only occur when cloud temperatures are signiﬁcantly below freezing. Referring back to Figure 2.1, at tempera-tures below freezing, there is a difference between the saturation vapour pressure curves of water and ice. This means that the air can be saturated for ice, but not for liquid water; the consequence of this is that the ice particles grow at the expense of the liquid water droplets. This happens by vapour diffusion where vapour diffuses from a higher pres-sure (cloud droplets) to a lower pressure (ice par-ticles). In other words, ice particles are very efﬁcient in attracting water vapour, which desublimates (deposits directly without liquid water) to grow the ice particles. The consequence is that the cloud becomes drier and what were cloud droplets, evapo-rate. This in turn provides more water vapour for desublimation, as a positive feedback process (Hen-driks 2010). As the ice particles grow heavier they fall to lower in the cloud where temperatures are around 0 °C, where they clump together forming snowﬂakes. This process of aggregation is thought to be more effective where ice particles are covered by a thin ﬁlm of supercooled water, making them ‘sticky’ as water freezes instantaneously on colli-sion (Shuttleworth 2012). This process appears to be most effective in the temperature range −4 to  0 °C, and the largest snowﬂakes are produced in the warmest area of the cloud. If temperature is warmer than 0 °C below the cloud, they will melt as they fall, falling as rain.Because clouds are usually a mixture of water vapour, liquid cloud droplets and ice crystals, the Bergeron process may be a signiﬁcant factor in making cloud droplets large enough to become rain drops (or ice/snow crystals) that overcome gravity and fall out of the clouds.The mechanisms of droplet formation within a cloud are not completely understood. The relative proportion of condensation-formed,  collision-formed, and Bergeron-process-formed droplets depends very much on the individual 26PRECIPITATION
be recognised (Table 2.2), and fog in arid environ-ments can be an important source of moisture for biological processes.PRECIPITATION DISTRIBUTIONThe amount of precipitation falling over a location varies both spatially and temporally (with time). The different inﬂuences on the precipitation can be divided into static and dynamic inﬂuences. Static inﬂuences are those such as altitude, aspect and slope; they do not vary between storm events. Dynamic influences are those that do change and are by and large caused by variations in the weather. At the global scale the inﬂuences on pre-cipitation distribution are mainly dynamic, being caused by differing weather patterns, but there are static factors such as topography that can also cause major variations through a rain shadow effect other surfaces have cooled to the point where water vapour coming into contact with them condenses onto the leaves and forms dew. Dew is not nor-mally a major part of the hydrological cycle but is another form of precipitation. Frost occurs in a similar way; either through later freezing of dewfall or when the surface on which it forms is less than 0 °C, so deposition or desublimation occurs, rather than condensation. Deposition of crystals can form intricate forms, called hoar frost.Mist and fogMist and fog occur under similar conditions to dewfall, and dew is often their precursor (Sumner 1988). Cooling air and condensation of dew causes a shallow layer of saturated air near the surface. Con-densation nuclei in this layer of air enable mist to form and progressively deepen and thicken, ulti-mately forming a fog where visibility is impaired (usually <200 m on land. Several types of fog can Table 2.1 Types of precipitationClassDeﬁnitionDrizzleA subset of ﬁne rain with droplets between 0.1 and 0.5 mm, but close togetherRainLiquid water droplets with diameter between 0.5 and 0.7 mm, but smaller if widely scatteredFreezing rain or drizzleRain or drizzle, the drops of which freeze on impact with a solid surface.

caused ﬂooding in the village of Epping Green, Essex, UK. Approximately 10 mm of rain fell within 1 hour, although there was no recorded rainfall in the village of Theydon Bois approxi-mately 10 km to the south. This large spatial dif-ference in rainfall was caused by the scale of the weather system causing the storm – in this case a convective thunderstorm. Often these types of variation lessen in importance over a longer time-scale so that the annual rainfall in Epping Green and Theydon Bois is very similar, whereas the daily rainfall may differ considerably. For the hydrolo-gist, who is interested in rainfall at the small scale, the only way to try and characterise these dynamic variations is through having as many rain gauges as possible within a study area.Static inﬂuences on precipitation distributionIt is easier for the hydrologist to account for static variables such as those discussed below.(see Case Study, pp. 29–30). At the continental scale, large differences in rainfall can be attributed to a mixture of static and dynamic factors. In Fig-ure 2.4 the rainfall distribution across the USA shows marked variations. Although mountainous areas have a higher rainfall, and also act as a block to rainfall reaching the drier centre of the country, they do not provide the only explanation for the variations evident in Figure 2.4. The higher rain-fall in the north-west states (Oregon and Washing-ton) is linked to wetter cyclonic weather systems from the northern Paciﬁc that do not reach down to southern California. Higher rainfall in Florida and other southern states is linked to the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea. These are examples of dynamic inﬂuences as they vary between rainfall events.At smaller scales, the static factors are often more dominant, although it is not uncommon for quite large variations in rainfall across a small area caused by individual storm clouds to exist. As an example: on 3 July 2000 an intense rainfall event Table 2.2 Types of fogType of fogDescriptionRadiation fogDuring the day the earth absorbs heat but radiates outwards at night, cooling the land and lower air layers. If sufﬁcient cooling occurs fog can develop. Ideal conditions include clear skies on long nights and slight winds to distribute the cold air over wider areas. This is the most common type of fog, usually occurring in valleys and typically around sunrise.Advection fogWhen warmer, moist air blows over a colder surface, the lower layers can cool sufﬁciently to condense. The fog often pictured around the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco forms in this way.Coastal fog or sea fogA type of advection fog where a warmer, moist ﬂow of air passes over the colder sea, cooling the lower layers until condensation occurs. Often found along the Californian coast, and the west coast of the Namibian desert where it is an important source of moisture.Hill or upslope fogMoist warmer air ﬂows up the windward slope, where it cools and condenses.Freezing fogComprised of supercooled water droplets at temperatures well below freezing. Rime occurs where supercooled droplets instantaneously freeze on contact with solid objects (e.g. telephone wires, trees)SmogAir pollution creates an abundance of condensation nuclei, so a thick fog can form under ideal conditions. Such conditions occurred regularly in the nineteenth and early twentieth century in London.28PRECIPITATION
in the distribution of precipitation throughout a catchment. In the humid mid-latitudes (35° to 65° north or south of the equator) the predomi-nant source of rainfall is through cyclonic weather systems arriving from the west. Slopes within a catchment that face eastwards will naturally be more sheltered from the rain than those facing westwards. The same principle applies everywhere: slopes with aspects facing away from the predomi-nant weather patterns will receive less rainfall than their opposites.SlopeThe inﬂuence of slope is only relevant at a very small scale. Unfortunately the measurement of rainfall AltitudeIt has already been explained that temperature is a critical factor in controlling the amount of water vapour that can be held by air. The cooler the air is, the less water vapour can be held. As temperature decreases with altitude it is reasonable to assume that as an air parcel gains altitude it is more likely to release the water vapour and cause higher rain-fall. This is exactly what does happen and there is a strong correlation between altitude and rainfall: so-called orographic precipitation.AspectThe inﬂuence of aspect is less important than altitude but it may still play an important part Figure 2.4 Mean annual precipitation across the USA (1981–2010).Source: Mapped using data from PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, http://prism.oregonstate.edu
PRECIPITATION29Rain shadow effectWhere there is a large and high land mass it is common to ﬁnd the rainfall considerably higher on one side than the other. This is through a combina-tion of altitude, slope, aspect and dynamic weather direction inﬂuences and can occur at many different scales (see Case Study below).occurs at a very small scale (i.e. a rain gauge). The difference between a level rain gauge on a hillslope, compared to one parallel to the slope, may be sig-niﬁcant. It is possible to calculate this difference if it is assumed that rain falls vertically – but of course rain does not always fall vertically. Consequently the effect of slope on rainfall measurements is nor-mally ignored.Case studyTHE RAIN SHADOW EFFECTThe predominant weather pattern for the South Island of New Zealand is a series of rain-bearing depressions sweeping up from the Southern Ocean, interrupted by drier blocking anticyclones. The Southern Alps form a major barrier to the fast-moving depressions and have a huge inﬂuence on the rainfall distribution within the South Island. Formed as part of tectonic uplift along the Paciﬁc/Indian plate boundary, the Southern Alps stretch the full length of the South Island (approximately 700 km) and at their highest point are over 3,000 m above mean sea level.The predominant weather pattern has a west-erly airﬂow, bringing moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the South Island. As this air is forced up over the Southern Alps it cools down and releases much of its moisture as rain and snow. As the air descends on the eastern side of the mountains it warms up and becomes a föhn wind, referred to locally as a ‘nor-wester’. The annual rainfall pat-terns for selected stations in the South Island are shown in Figure 2.5. The rain shadow effect can be clearly seen with the west coast rainfall being at least four times that of the east. Table 2.3 also illustrates the point, with the number of rain days at different sites in a cross section across the South Island. Although not shown on the transect in Figure 2.5, recordings of rainfall further north in the Southern Alps (Cropp River inland from Hokitika) are as high as 6 m a year.This pattern of rain shadow is seen at many different locations around the globe. It does not Figure 2.5 Rainfall distribution across the Southern Alps of New Zealand (South Island). Shaded areas on the map are greater than 1,500 m in elevation. A clear rain shadow effect can be seen between the much wetter west coast and the drier east.

Hayward and Clarke (1996) present data showing a strong rain shadow across the Freetown Penin-sula in Sierra Leone. They analysed mean monthly rainfall in 31 gauges within a 20 × 50 km area, and found that the rain shadow effect was most marked during the monsoon months of June to October. The gauges in locations facing the ocean (south-west aspect) caught considerably more rainfall during the monsoon than those whose aspect was towards the north-east and behind a small range of hills.
to estimation techniques where another variable is used as a surrogate for the water volume.Rainfall measurementThe earliest written reference to measuring rainfall dates from the fourth century BC in India (Strange-ways 2007), but systematic measurement of rainfall was in place in Korea by the mid-1400s (Figure 2.6a). The instrument for measuring rainfall is called a rain gauge. A rain gauge measures the volume of water that falls onto a horizontal surface delineated by the rain gauge rim (see Figure 2.6b). The collected vol-ume is converted into a rainfall depth through divi-sion by the rain gauge surface area. The modern rain gauge has its origins in the designs of Sir Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke (Strangeways 2007). The design of a rain gauge is not as simple as it may seem at ﬁrst glance as there are many errors and inac-curacies that need to be minimised or eliminated. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) suggests that errors are typically between 3 per cent and 30 per cent or more, depending on the gauge and weather and site conditions (WMO 2008), and errors are generally accepted to be of the order of 5–10 per cent, but higher for snow (Shuttleworth MEASUREMENTFor hydrological analysis it is important to know how much precipitation has fallen and when this occurred. The usual expression of precipitation is as a vertical depth of liquid water. Rainfall is mea-sured by millimetres or inches depth, rather than by volume such as litres or cubic metres. The measure-ment is the depth of water that would accumulate on the surface if all the rain remained where it had fallen (Shaw 1994). Snowfall may also be expressed as a depth, although for hydrological purposes it is most usefully described in water equivalent depth (i.e. the depth of water that would be present if the snow melted). This is a recognition that snow takes up a greater volume (as much as 90 per cent more) for the same amount of liquid water.There is a strong argument that can be made to say that there is no such thing as precipitation mea-surement at the catchment scale as it varies so tre-mendously over a small area. The logical end-point to this argument is that all measurement techniques are in fact precipitation estimation techniques. For the sake of clarity in this text, precipitation mea-surement techniques refer to the methods used to quantify the volume of water present, as opposed Table 2.3 Average annual rainfall and rain days for a cross section across South IslandWeather stationHeight above mean sea levelAnnual rainfall (mm)Rain daysHaast305,840175Mt Cook village770670120Tekapo76260477Timaru2554175Note: More details on weather differentials across the South Island of New Zealand are in Sinclair et al.

4 under-measurement due to turbulence around the gauge.Evaporation lossesA rain gauge can be any collector of rainfall with a known collection area; however, it is important that any rainfall that does collect is not lost again through evaporation. In order to eliminate, or at least lessen this loss, rain gauges are funnel shaped. In this way the rainfall is collected over a reasonably large area and then any water collected is passed through a narrow aperture to a collection tank underneath. Because the collection tank has a narrow top (i.e. the funnel mouth) there is very little interchange of air with the atmosphere above the gauge. As will be explained in Chapter 3, one of the necessary require-ments for evaporation is the turbulent mixing of saturated air with drier air above. By restricting this turbulent transfer there is little evaporation that can take place. In addition to this, the water awaiting 2012). When up-scaled to the catchment area, this represents signiﬁcant uncertainty in the major input of the water balance equation.There is a considerable scientiﬁc literature study-ing the accuracy and errors involved in measuring rainfall. It needs to be borne in mind that a rain gauge represents a very small point measurement (or sample) from a much larger area that is covered by the rainfall. Any errors in measurement will be ampliﬁed hugely because the rain gauge collection area repre-sents such a small sample size. Because of this ampli-ﬁcation it is extremely important that the design of a rain gauge negates any errors and inaccuracies.The four main sources of error in measuring rain-fall that need consideration in designing a method for the accurate measurement of rainfall are:1 losses due to evaporation2 losses due to wetting of the gauge3 over-measurement due to splash from the sur-rounding areaFigure 2.6 (a) A fourteenth-century rain gauge from Korea.

32PRECIPITATIONthat there will be very little splash-out. In extreme situations it is even possible that the rain gauge could be ﬂooded by water ﬂowing over the surface or cov-ered by snow. To overcome the splash, ﬂooding and snow coverage problem the rain gauge can be raised up above the ground (Figure 2.6) or placed in the middle of a non-splash grid (see Figure 2.7). Splash-in error is around 1–2 per cent (WMO 2008), primarily a function of rainfall intensity and wind speed. Gauge factors include the depth and shape of the gauge, and type of installation (WMO 2008).Turbulence around a raised gaugeIf a rain gauge is raised up above the ground (to reduce splash) another problem is created due to air turbulence around the gauge. The rain gauge presents an obstacle to the wind and the consequent aerodynamic interference leads to a reduced catch (see Figure 2.8). The amount of loss is dependent measurement is kept out of direct sunlight so that it will not be warmed; hence there is a low evapora-tion loss. Evaporation losses are estimated to be of the order of 0–4 per cent (WMO 2008) and would depend on meteorological factors such as the type of precipitation, the prevailing capacity of the air to hold water and the wind speed at the rim of the gauge over the period between rain collecting and a measurement being recorded. Instrumental factors would include for example, the funnel oriﬁce area and colour of the gauge (WMO 2008).Wetting lossAs the water trickles down the funnel it is inevitable that some water will stay on the surface of the funnel and can be lost to evaporation or not measured in the collection tank. This is often referred to as a wetting loss. These losses will not be large but may be sig-niﬁcant, particularly if the rain is falling as a series of small events on a warm day. In order to lessen this loss it is necessary to have steep sides on the funnel and to have a non-stick surface. The standard UK Meteorological Ofﬁce rain gauge is made of copper to create a non-stick surface, although many mod-ern rain gauges are made of non-adhesive plastics. Wetting loss is thought to be in the range of 2–10 per cent (WMO 2008), and meteorological factors include the type and frequency of precipitation, rel-ative to the drying time of the gauge and frequency of emptying. Gauge factors include the material and age of the gauge and collector (WMO 2008).Rain splashThe perfect rain gauge should measure the amount of rainfall that would have fallen on a surface if the gauge was not there. This suggests that the ideal situation for a rain gauge is ﬂush with the surface. A difﬁculty arises, however, as a surface-level gauge is likely to over-measure the catch due to rain landing adjacent to the gauge and splashing into it. If there was an equal amount of splash going out of the gauge then the problem might not be so severe, but the sloping sides of the funnel (to reduce evaporative losses) mean Figure 2.7 Surface rain gauge with non-splash surround.
Figure 2.8 The effect of wind turbulence on a raised rain gauge. An area of reduced pressure (and uplift) develops above the gauge in a similar manner to an aircraft wing. This reduces the rain gauge catch.
PRECIPITATION33non-splash surround, such as in Figure 2.7, can give very accurate measurement but it is prone to cover-age by heavy snowfall so cannot always be used. The non-splash surround allows adjacent rainfall to pass through (negating splash) but acts as an extended soil surface for the wind, thereby eliminating the turbulence problem from raised gauges. This may be the closest that it is possible to get to measuring the amount of rainfall that would have fallen on a surface if the rain gauge were not there.The standard UK Meteorological Ofﬁce rain gauge has been adopted around the world (although not everywhere) as a compromise between the fac-tors inﬂuencing rain gauge accuracy. It is a brass-rimmed rain gauge of 5 inches (127 mm) diameter standing 1 foot (305 mm) above the ground. The lack of height above ground level is a reﬂection of the low incidence of snowfall in the UK; in coun-tries such as Russia and Canada, where winter snowfall is the norm, gauges may be raised as high as 2 m above the surface. There is general recogni-tion that the UK standard rain gauge is not the best design for hydrology, but it does represent a reason-able compromise. There is a strong argument to be made against changing its design. Any change in the measurement instrument would make an analy-sis of past rainfall patterns difﬁcult due to the dif-fering accuracy.Siting of a rain gaugeOnce the best measurement device has been chosen for a location there is still a considerable measure-ment error that can occur through incorrect siting. The major problem of rain gauge siting in hydrol-ogy is that the scientist is trying to measure the rainfall at a location that is representative of a far greater area. It is extremely important that the measurement location is an appropriate surrogate for the larger area. If the area of interest is a forested catchment then it is reasonable to place your rain gauge beneath the forest canopy; likewise, within an urban environment it is reasonable to expect interference from buildings because this is what is happening over the larger area. What is extremely on both the wind speed and the raindrop diameter (Nes ˇpor and Sevruk 1999). At wind speeds of 20 km/hr (Beaufort scale 2) the loss could be up to 20 per cent, and in severe winds of 90 km/hr (Beaufort scale 8) up to 40 per cent (Bruce and Clark 1980; Rodda and Smith 1986). A generalised loss of 2.2 per cent for every 1 m/s increase in wind speed has been found (Larson and Peck 1974). The higher a gauge is from the surface, the greater the loss of accuracy. This creates a major problem for gauges in areas that receive large snowfalls as they need to be raised to avoid surface coverage.One method of addressing these turbulence dif-ﬁculties is through the ﬁtting of a shield to the rain gauge (see Figure 2.9). A rain gauge shield can take many forms (two examples are a Nipher shield and an Alter shield) but is often a series of batons surrounding the gauge at its top height. The shield acts as a calming measure for wind around the gauge and has been shown to greatly improve rain gauge accuracy.The optimum rain gauge designThere is no perfect rain gauge. The design of the best gauge for a site will be inﬂuenced by the individual conditions at the site (e.g. prevalence of snowfall, exposure, etc.). A rain gauge with a

each cross arm. When the bucket is full it tips the balance so that the full bucket is lowered down and empties out. At the time of tipping, a mag-net attached to the balance arm closes a small reed switch which sends an electrical signal to a data-logging device. This then records the exact time of the tipped bucket. If the rain continues to fall it ﬁlls the bucket on the other end of the cross arm until it too tips the balance arm, sending another electrical impulse to the data logger. In this way a near continuous measurement of rainfall with time can be obtained.important is that there are enough rain gauges to try to quantify the spatial and temporal variations.The rule-of-thumb method for siting a rain gauge is that the angle when drawn from the top of the rain gauge to the top of the obstacle is less than 30° (see Figure 2.10). This can be approximated as at least twice the height of the obstacle away from the gauge. Care needs to be taken to allow for the future growth of trees so that at all times during the rainfall record the distance apart is at least twice the height of an obstacle.Gauges for the continuous measurement of rainfallThe standard UK Meteorological Ofﬁce rain gauge collects water beneath its funnel and this volume is read once a day. Often in hydrology the data needs to be measured at a ﬁner timescale than this, partic-ularly in the case of individual storms which often last much less than a day. The most common mod-ern method for measuring continuous rainfall uses a tipping-bucket rain gauge. These are very simple devices that can be installed relatively cheaply, although they do require a data-logging device nearby. The principle behind the tipping-bucket rain gauge is that as the rain falls it ﬁlls up a small ‘bucket’ that is attached to another ‘bucket’ on a balanced cross arm (see Figure 2.11). The ‘buck-ets’ are very small plastic containers at the end of Figure 2.10 Siting of a rain gauge away from obstructions.
Figure 2.11 The inside of a tipping-bucket rain gauge. The ‘buckets’ are the small white, triangular reservoirs. These are balanced and when full they tip over, bringing the black arm past the other stationary arm. In doing so a small electrical current is passed to a data logger.
PRECIPITATION35heated rim so that any snow falling on the gauge melts to be collected as liquid water. Failure to have a heated rim may mean that the snow builds up on the gauge surface until it overﬂows. Provid-ing a heated rim is no simple logistical exercise as it necessitates a power source (difﬁcult in remote areas) and the removal of collected water well away from the heat source to minimise evapora-tion losses.A second modiﬁcation is to raise the gauge well above ground level so that as snow builds up the gauge is still above this surface. Unfortunately the raising of the gauge leads to an increase in the tur-bulence errors described for rain gauges. For this reason it is normal to have wind deﬂectors or shields surrounding the gauge.Snow depthThe simplest method of measuring snow depth is the use of a core sampler. This takes a core of snow, recording its depth at the same time, that can then be melted to derive the water equiva-lent depth. It is this that is of importance to a hydrologist. The major difficulties of a core sample are that it is a non-continuous reading (similar to daily rainfall measurement), and the position of coring may be critical (because of snow drifting).A second method of measuring snow depth is to use a snow pillow. This is a method for measuring snow accumulation, a form of water storage, hence it is described in Chapter 4 (p. 81).Summary of the challenges in point measurementAs is evident from the preceding discussion, the estimation of precipitation at a point is challenging. Figure 2.12 summarises a range of possible errors inﬂuencing catch recorded at a site. In the next sec-tion we will move on to how one might generalise point rainfall over a wider area and this process has even greater shortfalls, further compounding the total error in estimating precipitation.It is important that the correct size of tipping bucket is used for the prevailing conditions. If the buckets are too small then a very heavy rainfall event will cause them to ﬁll too quickly and water be lost through overspill while the mechanism tips. If the buckets are too large then a small rainfall event may not cause the cross arm to tip and the subsequent rainfall event will appear larger than it actually was. The tipping-bucket rain gauge shown in Figure 2.11 has an equivalent depth of 0.2 mm of rain which works well for ﬁeld studies in south-east England, but would be inadequate for a tropi-cal downpour.Snowfall measurementThe measurement of snowfall has similar prob-lems to those presented by rainfall, but they are often more extreme. There are two meth-ods used for measuring snowfall: using a gauge like a rain gauge; or measuring the depth that is present on the ground. Both of these meth-ods have very large errors associated with them, predominantly caused by the way that snow falls through the atmosphere and is deposited on the gauge or ground. Most, although not all, snow-ﬂakes are more easily transported by the wind than raindrops are. When the snow reaches the ground it is easily blown around in a secondary manner (drifting). This can be contrasted to liq-uid water where, upon reaching the ground, it is either absorbed by the soil or moves across the surface. Rainfall is very rarely picked up by the wind again and redistributed in the manner that drifting snow is. For the snow gauge this presents problems that are analogous to rain splash. For the depth gauge the problem is due to uneven distribution of the snow surface: it is likely to be deeper in certain situations.Rain gauge modiﬁcation to include snowfallOne modiﬁcation that needs to be made to a stan-dard rain gauge in order to collect snowfall is a 36PRECIPITATION
In reality, the hydrologist needs to know how much precipitation has fallen over a far larger area, usually a catchment. To move from point measurements to a spatially distributed estimation it is necessary to employ some form of spatial averaging. The spatial averaging must attempt to account for an uneven spread of rain gauges in the catchment and the various MOVING FROM POINT MEASUREMENT TO SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED ESTIMATIONThe measurement techniques described here have all concentrated on measuring rainfall at a precise location (or at least over an extremely small area).

where ri is the rainfall at gauge i, ai is the area of the polygon surrounding rain gauge i, and A is the total catchment area (ai/A is therefore the propor-tion of the catchment occupied by each polygon, and the set of these for a catchment are known as Thiessen coefﬁcients).The areal rainfall value using Thiessen’s poly-gons is a weighted mean, with the weighting being based upon the size of each representative area (polygon). This technique is only truly valid where the topography is uniform within each polygon so that it can be safely assumed that the rainfall distri-bution is uniform within the polygon. This would suggest that it can only work where the rain gauges factors that we know inﬂuence rainfall distribution (e.g. altitude, aspect and slope). A simple arithmetic mean will only work where a catchment is sampled by uniformly spaced rain gauges and where there is no diversity in topography. If these conditions were ever truly met then it is unlikely that there would be more than one rain gauge sampling the area. Hence it is very rare to use a simple averaging technique.There are different statistical techniques that address the spatial distribution issues, and with the growth in use of Geographic Information Sys-tems (GIS) it is often a relatively trivial matter to do the calculation. As with any computational task it is important to have a good knowledge of how the technique works so that any shortcomings are fully understood. Three techniques are described here: Thiessen’s polygons, the hypsometric method and the isohyetal method. These meth-ods are explored further in a Case Study on p. 40.Thiessen’s polygonsThiessen was an American engineer working around the start of the twentieth century who devised a simple method of overcoming an uneven distribu-tion of rain gauges within a catchment (very much the norm). Essentially Thiessen’s polygons (Thiessen 1911) attach a representative area to each rain gauge. The size of the representative area (a polygon) is based on how close each gauge is to the others surrounding it, but all points within a polygon are closer to its rain gauge than any of the other rain gauges.Polygons are drawn by connecting the nearest rain gauges to each other by lightly drawn lines. The per-pendicular bisector of each connecting line is then found, and these are extended to where they intersect with other perpendicular bisectors. The boundaries of the polygons are therefore equidistant from each gauge (see Figure 2.13). Once the polygons have been drawn, the area of each polygon surrounding a rain gauge is found. The spatially averaged rainfall (R) is calculated using Formula 2.1:RraAinii=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟=∑1 (2.1)

ignored). It also assumes that the relationship between altitude and rainfall is linear, which is not always the case and warrants exploration before using this technique.Isohyetal methodWhere there are a large number of gauges within a catchment the most obvious weighting to apply on a mean is based on measured rainfall distribution rather than on surrogate measures as described above. In this case a map of the catchment rainfall distri-bution can be drawn by interpolating between the rainfall values, creating a smoothed rainfall surface. The traditional isohyetal method involved drawing isohyets (lines of equal rainfall) on the map and cal-culating the area between each isohyet. The spatial average could then be calculated by Equation 2.3:RraAinji=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟=∑1 (2.3)are located initially with this technique in mind (i.e. a priori).Hypsometric methodSince it is well known that rainfall is positively inﬂuenced by altitude (i.e. the higher the altitude the greater the rainfall) it is reasonable to assume that knowledge of the catchment elevation can be brought to bear on the spatially distributed rain-fall estimation problem. The simplest indicator of the catchment elevation is the hypsometric (or hypsographic) curve. This is a graph showing the proportion of a catchment above or below a certain elevation. The values for the curve can be derived from maps using a planimeter or using a digital elevation model (DEM) in a GIS.The hypsometric method of calculating spatially distributed rainfall then calculates a weighted average based on the proportion of the catchment between two elevations and the measured rainfall between those elevations (Equation 2.2).RraAinji=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟=∑1 (2.2)where rj is the average rainfall between two con-tour intervals, ai is the area between those contours (derived from the hypsometric curve), and A is the total catchment area. So ai/A is again the proportion of the catchment, but this time on the basis of the area between the contours rather than each polygon, as was the case in the previous method. The rj value may be an average of several rain gauges where there is more than one at a certain contour interval. This is illustrated in Figure 2.14 where the shaded area (a3) has two gauges within it. In this case the rj value will be an average of r4 and r5.Intuitively this is producing representative areas for one or more gauges based on contours and spac-ing, rather than just on the latter as for Thiessen’s polygons. There is an inherent assumption that elevation is the only topographic parameter affect-ing rainfall distribution (i.e. slope and aspect are Figure 2.14 Calculation of areal rainfall using the hyp-sometric method. The shaded region is between two contours. In this case the rainfall is an average between the two gauges within the shaded area. Locations of rain gauges are indicated by bullet points.
PRECIPITATION39is where the difference between values at pairs of points tends to reduce with increasing proximity (i.e. the closer they are together the more likely they are to be similar). One approach is called krig-ing, which comprises a two stage process. The ﬁrst step in this process is to establish how ‘predictable’ the values are at each sampled point from all other sampled points. This analysis results in a special type of graph known as a semi-variogram which rep-resents the differences between the known value at one location and the value at a different location based on the distance (and sometimes the direc-tion) between them. This deﬁnes the covariance of points, a measure of how much two random vari-ables change together. The second stage is where the value of points at unsampled locations (where values are not known), are estimated. A weighted average of neighbouring known points is used to estimate the unsampled points, with the weights being determined on the basis of information from the semi-variogram. Co-kriging is a variation of this approach where other variables (e.g. elevation) can be included (Shaw et al. 2011). What is particu-larly useful about these methods, is that they can also provide an estimate of the uncertainty of esti-mation. A fuller explanation of these techniques is provided by Bailey and Gatrell (1995).An additional piece of information that can be gained from interpolated rainfall surfaces is the likely rainfall at a particular point within the catch-ment. This may be more useful information than total rainfall over an area, particularly when needed for numerical simulation of hydrological processes.The difﬁculty in moving from the point measure-ment to a spatially distributed average is a prime example of the problem of scale that besets hydrol-ogy. The scale of measurement (i.e. the rain gauge surface area) is far smaller than the catchment area that is frequently our concern. Is it feasible to simply scale up our measurement from point sources to the overall catchment? Or should there be some form of scaling factor to acknowledge the large discrepancy? There is no easy answer to these questions and they are the type of problem that research in hydrology will be investigating in the twenty-ﬁrst century.where ai is the area between each isohyet and ri is the average rainfall between the isohyets. This technique is analogous to Figure 2.14, except in this case the contours will be of rainfall rather than elevation.GIS, interpolation and other spatial statistical techniquesIf you undertook manual interpolation in applying the isohyetal method above, you would be undertak-ing linear interpolation, where the interpolated value between two known points is directly proportional to the distance between them. With the advent of GIS, interpolating and drawing of isohyets can be done relatively easily, and GIS offers a wide range of methods beyond simple linear interpolation. GIS-based methods generally subdivide the catch-ment into small grid cells and then assign a rainfall value for each grid cell to derive a rainfall surface by smoothing or interpolation. In both approaches measured values are used to generate a surface, but in the case of smoothing methods the surface does not necessarily pass through the points, whereas in the case of interpolation it does (Dingman 2008). There are several different ways of carrying out the interpolation, for example, the inverse distance, or nearest neighbour methods. In nearest neighbour interpolations, the assigned rainfall value for a grid square is proportional to the nearest rain gauges. In the case of the inverse distance method, the closer a rainfall station is to a point the greater the relative weighting; interpolation is therefore on a non-linear basis. Surface smoothing approaches such as the spline method ﬁt a surface using low order polyno-mial functions. These approaches are also referred to as multi-quadric surface methods (Shaw et al. 2011).While smoothing and interpolation are examples of one type of approach to developing a surface from a number of point estimates, there is an alterna-tive category of approaches based on geostatistics. These techniques have their origin in mining appli-cations where, for example, surfaces needed to be generated on the basis of point samples of mineral concentrations in ore. They are well-suited to any analysis where there is spatial correlation, which 40PRECIPITATIONCase studyRAINFALL DISTRIBUTION IN A SMALL STUDY CATCHMENTIt is well known that large variations in rainfall occur over quite a small spatial scale. Despite this, there are not many studies that have looked at this problem in detail. One study that has investigated spatial variability in rainfall was carried out in the Plynlimon research catchments in mid-Wales (Clarke et al. 1973). In setting up a hydrologi-cal monitoring network in the Wye and Severn catchments, 38 rain gauges were installed to try and characterise the rainfall variation. The rainfall network had 18 rain gauges in the Severn catch-ment (total area 8.7 km2) and 20 gauges in the Wye (10.55 km2).The monthly data for a period between April 1971 and March 1973 were analysed to calculate areal average rainfall using contrasting methods. The results from this can be seen in Figure 2.15. The most startling feature of Figure 2.15 is the lack of difference in calculated values and that they follow no regular pattern. At times the arithme-tic mean is greater than the others while in other months it is less. When the total rainfall for the 2-year period is looked at, the Thiessen’s calcula-tion is 0.3 per cent less than the arithmetic mean, while the isohyetal method is 0.4 per cent less.When the data were analysed to see how many rain gauges would be required to characterise the rainfall distribution fully it was found that the number varied with the time period of rainfall and the season being measured. When monthly data were looked at there was more variability in winter rainfall than summer. For both winter and summer it showed that anything less than ﬁve rain gauges (for the Wye) increased the variance markedly.A more detailed statistical analysis of hourly mean rainfall showed a far greater number of gauges were required. Four gauges would give an accuracy in areal estimate of around 50 per cent, while a 90 per cent accuracy would require 100 gauges (Clarke et al. 1973: 62).The conclusions that can be drawn from the study of Clarke et al. (1973) are of great concern to hydrology. It would appear that even for a small catchment a large number of rain gauges are required to try and estimate rainfall values properly. This conﬁrms the statement made at the start of this chapter: although rainfall is relatively straightforward to measure, it is notoriously dif-ﬁcult to measure accurately and, to compound the problem, it is also extremely variable within a catchment area.Figure 2.15 Areal mean rainfall (monthly) for the Wye catchment, calculated using three different methods.Source: Data from Clarke et al.

RAINFALL INTENSITY AND STORM DURATIONWater depth is not the only rainfall measure of interest in hydrology; also of importance is the rainfall intensity and storm duration. These are simple to obtain from an analysis of rainfall records using frequency analysis. The rainfall needs to be recorded at a short time interval (i.e. an hour or less) to provide meaningful data.Figure 2.16 shows the rainfall intensity for a rain gauge at Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, UK.

When the UK site rainfall and intensity curves are looked at together (i.e. Figures 2.16 and 2.17) it can be stated that Bradwell-on-Sea experiences a predom-inance of low intensity, short duration rainfall events and very few long duration, high intensity storms. This type of information is extremely useful to a hydrologist investigating the likely runoff response that might be expected for the rainfall regime.In engineering hydrology, extensive use is made of relationships known as depth–duration– frequency (DDF) curves (see Figure 1.12), or the related  intensity–duration frequency (IDF) curves. In Fig-ure 2.18, the same data as in Figure 1.12 have been used to derive the curves, the difference being that instead of depth of rainfall (mm), the average inten-sity (mm/hr) for each duration has been calculated. Whereas in Figure 1.12 the depth increases over time but ﬂattens off, in Figure 2.18, the curve starts off at very high intensity and then decreases over time. In the United Kingdom, the Flood estimation handbook (CEH 1999) and accompanying CD-ROM provided access to depth–duration–frequency relationships for any location in the UK (1999 DDF). This has now been superseded by the 2013 DDF relationships available via the FEH Web Service (https://fehweb.ceh.ac.uk). In the US, very useful data are available from the diagram that the majority of rain falls at very low intensity: 0.4 mm per hour is considered as light rain. This may be misleading as the rain gauge recorded rainfall every hour and the small amount of rain may have fallen during a shorter period than an hour i.e. a higher intensity but lasting for less than an hour. During the period of measurement there were recorded rainfall intensities greater than 4.4 mm/hr (maximum 6.8 mm/hr) but they were so few as to not show up on the histogram scale used in Figure 2.16. This may be a reﬂection of only 2 years of records being analysed, which reﬂects an extremely important concept in hydrology: the frequency–magnitude r e l a t i o n s h i p ,  a s  i n t r o-duced in Chapter 1. With rainfall (and runoff –  see Chapters 7 and 8) the larger the rainfall event the less frequent we would expect it to be. This is not a linear relationship; as illustrated in Figure 2.16 the curve declines in a non-linear fashion. If we think of the relative frequency as a probability then we can say that the chances of having a low rainfall event are very high: a low magnitude–high frequency event. Conversely the chances of having a rainfall intensity greater than 5 mm/hr are very low (but not impos-sible): a high magnitude–low frequency event.In Figure 2.17 the storm duration records for two different sites are compared. The Bradwell-on-Sea site has the majority of its rain events lasting  1 hour or less. In contrast the Ahoskie site has only 20

Satellite remote sensing looks from space down towards the earth surface and attempts to estimate the amount of precipitation falling over an area.RadarThe main use of ground-based radar is in weather forecasting where it is used to track the movement of rain clouds and fronts across the earth’s surface. This in itself is interesting but does not provide the hydrological requirement of estimating how much rain is falling over an area.There are several techniques used for radar, although they are all based on similar principles. Radar is an acronym (radio detection and rang-ing). A wave of electromagnetic energy is emitted from a unit on the ground and the amount of wave reﬂection and return time is recorded. The more via NOAA’s National Weather Service Precipitation Frequency Data Server (PFDS) (http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds) which provides State-based depth–duration–frequency data.SURROGATE MEASURES FOR ESTIMATING RAINFALLThe difﬁculties in calculation of a spatially distrib-uted precipitation value from point measurements make the direct estimation of areal precipitation an attractive proposition. There are two techniques that make some claim to achieving this: radar, and satellite remote sensing. These approaches have many similarities, but they differ fundamentally in the direction of measurement. Radar looks from the earth up into the atmosphere and tries to estimate the amount of precipitation falling over an area.

These are the characteristics that can be observed from space by a satellite sensor. The most common form of satellite sensor is passive (this means it receives radiation from another source, normally the sun, rather than emitting any itself the way radar does) and detects radiation in the vis-ible and infrared wavebands. LANDSAT, SPOT and AVHRR are examples of satellite platforms of this type. By sensing in the visible and infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, the cloud bright-ness (visible) and temperature (thermal infrared) can be detected. This so-called ‘brightness tem-perature’ can then be related to rainfall intensity via calibration with point rainfall measurements, in a similar fashion to ground-based radar. One of the problems with this approach is that it is some-times difﬁcult to distinguish between snow reﬂect-ing light on the ground and clouds reﬂecting light in the atmosphere. They have similar brightness temperature values but need to be differentiated so that accurate rainfall assessment can be made.Another form of satellite sensor that can be used is passive microwave. The earth emits microwaves (at a low level) that can be detected from space. When there is liquid water between the earth’s surface and the satellite sensor (i.e. a cloud in the atmosphere) some of the microwaves are absorbed by the water. A satellite sensor can therefore detect the presence of clouds (or other bodies of water on the surface) as a lack of microwaves reaching the sensor. An early example of a study using a satellite platform that can detect passive microwaves (SSM/I) is in Todd and Bailey (1995), who used the method to assess rainfall over the United Kingdom. Although there was some success in the method it was at a scale of little use to catchment scale hydrology as the best resolution available was around 10 × 10 km grid sizes. More recent satellites (e.g. TRMM and the later GMP (see Case Study below) use on-board K-band microwave transmitters and measure the return of back-scattered microwave radiation.Although these recent developments have added considerably to our understanding of global precip-itation (Figure 2.19 (a) and (b)), their real beneﬁt is in the global scale datasets that are generated, water there is in a cloud the more electromagnetic energy is reﬂected back to the ground and detected by the radar unit. The quicker the reﬂected wave reaches the ground, the closer the cloud is to the surface. The most difﬁcult part of this technique is in ﬁnding the best wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to emit and detect. It is important that the electromagnetic wave is reﬂected by liquid water in the cloud, but not atmospheric gases and/or chang-ing densities of the atmosphere. A considerable amount of research effort has gone into trying to ﬁnd the best wavelengths for ground-based radar to use. The solution appears to be that it is somewhere in the microwave band (commonly C-band), but that the exact wavelength depends on the individual situation being studied (Cluckie and Collier 1991).Studies have shown a good correlation between reﬂected electromagnetic waves and rainfall inten-sity. Therefore, this can be thought of as a surrogate measure for estimating rainfall. If an accurate esti-mate of rainfall intensity is required, then a rela-tionship has to be derived using several calibrating rain gauges. Herein lies a major problem with this type of technique: there is no universal relationship that can be used to derive rainfall intensity from cloud reﬂectivity. An individual calibration has to be derived for each site and this may involve sev-eral years of measuring point rainfall coincidentally with cloud reﬂectivity. This is not a cheap option and the cost prohibits its widespread usage, par-ticularly in areas with poor rain gauge coverage.In Britain the UK Meteorological Ofﬁce operates a series of 15 weather radars with a 5 km resolu-tion that provide images every 15 minutes. This is a more intensive coverage than could be expected in most countries. Although portable radar can be used for rainfall estimation, their usage has been limited by the high cost of purchase.Satellite remote sensingThe atmosphere-down approach of satellite remote sensing is quite different from the ground-up approach of radar – fundamentally because the sen-sor is looking at the top of a cloud rather than the bottom. It is well established that a cloud most Figure 2.19 Examples of satellite-derived global rainfall distribution in the month of (a) January and (b) July.Source: Image from NOAA (www.ncdc.noaa.gov)PRECIPITATION45signiﬁcantly improve estimation of areal precipita-tion. It is important to remember too, that satel-lite remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of precipitation over an area and still requires ground observations for validation.which can be used in global models. They are also very important in regions where ground measure-ments are limited (e.g. Kidd et al. 1998), but in countries with high rain gauge density and/or a good ground-based radar network, it does not Case studyACTIVE REMOTE SENSING OF GLOBAL PRECIPITATIONA commonly accepted limitation of traditional site-based measurement is the lack of continu-ous, detailed spatio-temporal data. This limits its application in hydrological models. The main ben-eﬁt of a remote sensing approach to precipitation monitoring is that it is a more cost-effective way to generate representative and continuous rainfall records over larger temporal and spatial scales than was previously possible. Precipitation measure-ments of this sort can be estimated from the back scattering of microwave radiation emitted from a satellite (this is active as opposed to passive remote sensing). These active satellites often use K-Band radar enabled instruments to map global scale pre-cipitation at a daily resolution. We will consider two of the most important initiatives in this form of remote sensing.Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM)The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) was launched in November 1997 as a joint mission between the US National Aeronau-tics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). This was the ﬁrst satellite dedicated to measur-ing tropical and subtropical rainfall, and the ﬁrst satellite to carry speciﬁc microwave precipitation radar instrumentation (as well as other sensors). TRMM operated in a non-polar, low inclination orbit (≈400 km above Earth’s surface), so focused mainly on the tropical and sub-tropical regions of Earth (35°S–35°N). From this restricted orbital cycle, TRMM completed 16 full cycles per day with a measurement swath of 878 km. The spatial resolution of TRMM data varies between 0.25° and 5°. Although the mission has ended (it was decommissioned in April 2015), it successfully captured high resolution precipitation data for over 15 years, forming an important legacy data-set useful to scientists for detecting and under-standing climate variability and change. Products produced by the mission included near real-time 3-hour global rainfall data, 7-day accumulated global rainfall data, and other processed datasets such as averages and anomalies. For more detail on the TRMM mission see: https://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM.Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission succeeded TRMM. Although initiated by NASA and JAXA, it is now a wider consortium of several international space agencies, which oper-ates a constellation of satellites. The main satel-lite, known as the ‘GPM Core Observatory’ was launched in February 2014. Like the TRMM sat-ellite, it operates in a non-polar, low inclination orbit (407 km above Earth’s surface), completing 16 orbits per day – but across a wider propor-tion of the Earth’s surface (65°S–65°N). Using a constellation of satellites enables a revisit time of 1–2 hours. The IMERG algorithm combines data 46PRECIPITATIONfrom all passive microwave instruments across the GPM constellation, and provides gridded precipi-tation datasets at a variety of temporal resolutions (up to 3 hours), and at intervals from close to real time (6-hour lag). The spatial resolution of GPM datasets ranges between 4.4 and 32 km, depend-ing on latitude. For more detail on the GPM mis-sion see: https://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM.Comparing TRMM & GPMTRMM, due to its restricted orbit, only monitored precipitation across the global tropics. While it also is non-polar, GPM has a wider monitoring range across middle and high latitudes due to technological advancements in remote sensing instrumentation. GPM also has a higher spatial resolution and improved sensor detection of light rain and snow. Therefore, GPM products are con-sidered to have greater accuracy. Many hydrologi-cal systems and applications which used TRMM data are now being reconﬁgured and are under-going transition to GPM datasets. These include international extreme rain, ﬂood and drought monitoring systems. Going forward it is likely that TRMM and GPM data products will be inter-calibrated to provide a combined long-term, high temporal resolution, precipitation record.TRMM & GPM applicationsThe precipitation datasets produced by TRMM and GPM have been used in a range of hydro-meteorological applications.1 TRMM/GPM has allowed scientists to exam-ine the internal structure of tropical storm systems, increasing our understanding of high rainfall events and implications of such sys-tems beyond the tropics.2 The microwave radar equipment on-board TRMM, and now GPM, enables scientists to monitor the microscale characteristics of indi-vidual raindrops. This allows for the monitoring of the type/intensity/distribution of water in the atmosphere, and increases our understand-ing of global atmospheric circulation.3 Beyond water stored in the atmosphere, TRMM/GPM datasets have enabled us to develop understanding around the rate of water/moisture transfer around the hydrologi-cal cycle. This often involves combining TRMM/GPM with land surface data.4 Due to the extensive temporal record of TRMM/GPM datasets scientists can develop an understanding of the changing temporal and spatial extent of extreme ﬂoods and droughts at a global scale due to climate change.Data from both the TRMM and GPM mis-sions is provided by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre, free of charge in various formats. To access these datasets go to: https://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access.The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)Another important international initiative is the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) established by the World Climate Research Pro-gram (WCRP) in the late 1990s. It holds the longest global precipitation data record (1979–  present). The GPCP aims to provide a consis-tent measure of global precipitation by integrat-ing various satellite and ground-based data sets derived from a mix of observations in space and time.It provides daily or monthly precipitation at  1° × 1° spatial resolution, from 1979 onwards. It is a core dataset in the analysis of global pre-cipitation and has been used in over 1500 articles in scientiﬁc journals.

2,"Evaporation is the transferral of liquid water into a gaseous state and its diffusion into the atmosphere (Figure 1.4). In order for this to occur there must be liquid water present and available energy from the sun or atmosphere. The importance of evaporation within the hydrological cycle depends very much on the amount of water present and the available energy, two factors determined by a region’s climate. During winter months in humid-temperate climates, evapora-tion may be a minor component of the hydrological cycle as there is very little available energy to drive the evaporative process. This alters during summer when there is abundant available energy and evapora-tion has the potential to become a major part of the water balance. The potential may be limited by the availability of liquid water during the dry months. This can be seen in extremely hot, arid climates where there is often plenty of available energy to drive evapo-ration but very little water to be evaporated. As a con-sequence, the actual amount of evaporation is small.It is the presence or lack of water at the surface that provides the major semantic distinction in deﬁnitions of the evaporative process. Open water evaporation (often denoted as Eo) is the evapora-tion that occurs above a body of water such as a lake, stream or the oceans. Figure 1.7 shows that at the global scale this is the largest source of evapora-tion, in particular from the oceans. Potential evap-oration (PE) is that which occurs over the land’s surface, or would occur if the water supply were unrestricted. This occurs when a soil is wet and what evaporation is able to happen occurs without a lack of water supply. Actual evaporation (Et) is that which actually occurs (i.e. if there is not much LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of the fundamental process of evaporation and what controls its rate. /H17039A knowledge of the techniques for measuring evaporation directly. /H17039A knowledge of the techniques used to estimate evaporation. /H17039An understanding of the importance of vegetation in determining regional evaporation.3EVAPORATION50EVAPORATIONdescription of the hydrological cycle and by deﬁ-nition there are no losses and gains within this cycle. What is meant by ‘loss’ is that evaporation is lost from the earth’s surface, since hydrologists are mostly concerned with the water that contrib-utes to sustaining streamﬂow. To a meteorologist concerned with the atmosphere, evaporation can be seen as a gain. Evaporation, although not a loss, can be viewed as the opposite of precipitation, particu-larly in the case of dewfall, a form of precipitation. In this case the dewfall (or negative evaporation) is a gain to the earth’s surface.EVAPORATION AS A PROCESSWe will begin by taking a closer look at the process of evaporation. As mentioned in the introduction, evaporation means the transferral of liquid water into a gaseous state. In liquid, water molecules are mov-ing constantly (Brownian motion) and adding addi-tional heat (energy) causes water molecules to move more rapidly and further apart, weakening the forces holding them together. At higher temperatures, some water molecules near the surface have sufﬁcient energy to break free from the surface of the water and escape into the surrounding air. Think of this as the ‘boiling-off rate’ or rate of vaporisation (Figure 3.1).  available water it will be less than potential). When conditions are very wet (e.g. during a rainfall event) Et will equal PE, otherwise it will be less than PE. In hydrology we are most interested in Eo and Et but normally require PE to calculate the Et value.All of these deﬁnitions have been concerned with ‘evaporation over a surface’. In hydrology the sur-face is either water (river, lake, ponds, etc.) or the land. The evaporation above a land surface occurs in two ways – either as actual evaporation from the soil matrix or transpiration from plants. The com-bination of these two is often referred to as evapo-transpiration, although the term actual evaporation is essentially the same (hence the t subscript in Et). Transpiration from a plant occurs as part of photo-synthesis and respiration. The rate of transpiration is controlled by the opening or closing of stomata in the leaf. Transpiration can be ascertained at the indi-vidual plant level by instruments measuring the ﬂow of water up the trunk or stem of a plant. Different species of plants transpire at different rates but the fundamental controls are the available water in the soil, the plant’s ability to transfer water from the soil to its leaves and regulate its stomata, and the abil-ity of the atmosphere to absorb the transpired water.Evaporation is sometimes erroneously described as the only loss within the water balance equa-tion. The water balance equation is a mathematical

This is most easily understood as the heat we feel as warmth. The sensible heat ﬂux is the rate of ﬂow of that sensible heat. Latent heat is the heat either absorbed or released during a phase change from ice to liquid water, or liquid water to water vapour. When water moves from liquid to gas this is a negative ﬂux (i.e. energy is absorbed) whereas the opposite phase change (gas to liquid) produces a positive heat ﬂux.The soil heat ﬂux is heat released from the soil having been previously stored within the soil. This is frequently ignored as it tends to zero over a 24-hour period and is a relatively minor contribu-tor to net radiation.Incoming solar radiation is ﬁltered by the atmo-sphere so that not all the wavelengths of the elec-tromagnetic spectrum are received at the earth’s surface. Incoming radiation that reaches the sur-face is often referred to as short-wave radiation: visible light plus some bands of the infrared. This is not strictly true as clouds and water vapour in the atmosphere, plus trees and tall buildings above the surface, emit longer-wave radiation which also reaches the surface.Outgoing radiation can be either reﬂected short-wave radiation or energy radiated back by the earth’s surface. In the latter case this is normally in the infrared band and longer wavelengths and is referred to as long-wave radiation. This is a major source of energy for evaporation.There are two other forms of available energy that under certain circumstances may be impor-tant sources in the evaporation process. The ﬁrst is heat stored in buildings from an anthropogenic source (e.g. domestic heating). This energy source is often fuelled from organic sources and may be a signiﬁcant addition to the heat budget in an urban environment, particularly in the winter months. The second additional source is advective energy. This is energy that originates from elsewhere (another region that may be hundreds or thousands of kilometres away) and has been transported to the evaporative surface (frequently in the form of latent heat) where it becomes available energy in the form of sensible heat. The best example of this is latent Even the driest air contains some water vapour and these molecules too, are in constant motion. Some of those close to the water surface will move into the liquid water – think of this as the ‘re-entry’ rate, or rate of condensation. Evaporation is the net balance between the two processes of vaporisation and condensation (Ward and Robinson 2000).Now think of a half-ﬁlled, closed bottle of water standing in the sun. Liquid water will evaporate, and this is controlled by the temperature of the liquid water. As water vaporises, the concentration of water molecules in the top half increases, as does the vapour pressure. The vapour pressure in turn controls the condensation rate: the higher the vapour pressure, the higher the condensation rate. Since in a sealed container the vapour has nowhere to go, the rates of vaporisation and condensation eventually equal each other, and this is the point at which the air is saturated.It has already been said that evaporation requires an energy source and an available water supply to transform liquid water into water vapour. There is one more precondition: that the atmosphere be dry enough to receive any water vapour produced (as we have seen above, evaporation ceases once the air becomes saturated). These are the three fundamental parts to an understanding of the evaporation process. This was ﬁrst understood by John Dalton (1766–1844), an English physicist who linked wind speed and the dryness of the air to the evaporation rate.Available energyThe main source of energy for evaporation is from the sun. This is not necessarily in the form of direct radiation, it is often absorbed by a surface and then re-radiated at a different wavelength. The normal term used to describe the amount of energy received at a surface is net radiation (Q*), measured using a net radiometer. Net radiation is a sum of all the different heat ﬂuxes found at a surface and can be described by Equation 3.1.Q* = QS ± QL ± QG (3.1)where QS is the sensible heat ﬂux; QL is the latent heat ﬂux and QG is the soil heat ﬂux.52EVAPORATIONwith water vapour and that there is enough buoyancy to move the water vapour away from the surface. These two elements can be assessed in terms of the vapour pressure deﬁcit and atmospheric mixing.In Chapter 2 we explored the relationship between temperature and vapour pressure, highlighting that the maximum amount of water vapour that can be held in a parcel of air is deﬁned by the curve in Fig-ures 2.1 and 3.2. At all the points along the curve, the air is saturated or at absolute humidity. You will recall from Chapter 2 that absolute humidity is the maximum mass of water that air can obtain (mea-sured in g/kg) at each of the temperatures along the curve. However, let us assume that the atmosphere is not saturated at a particular temperature, but located at point A in Figure 3.2 (actual vapour pressure = 10.0 hPa). The relative humidity of the atmosphere (i.e. how close to fully saturated the atmosphere is) is deﬁned as the ratio of the actual vapour pressure rela-tive to the maximum possible at that temperature (saturated vapour pressure = 23.4 hPa), expressed as a percentage. So at point A, the relative humidity is 42.7 per cent (10.0 hPa/23.4 hPa × 100). The difference between the actual vapour pressure (point A) and the saturation vapour pressure (point B) is the vapour pressure deﬁcit (vpd), also called the satura-tion deﬁcit. The vpd is a measure of how much extra water vapour the atmosphere could hold assuming a constant temperature and pressure. In Figure 3.2 the vpd is 13.4 hPa (23.4 – 10 = 13.4 hPa), so that air is capable of holding enough extra water vapour to create an additional 13.4 hPa of vapour pressure. The higher the vpd the more water can be absorbed from an evaporative surface.Atmospheric mixing is a general term meaning how well a parcel of air is able to diffuse into the atmo-sphere surrounding it. The best indicator of atmo-spheric mixing is the wind speed at different heights above an evaporating surface. If the wind speed is zero, the parcel of air will not move away from the evapora-tive surface and will ‘ﬁll’ with water vapour. As the wind speed increases, the parcel of air will be moved quickly on to be replaced by another, possibly drier, parcel ready to absorb more water vapour. If the evapo-rative surface is large (e.g. a lake) it is important that energy that arrives in cyclonic storm systems. In Chapter 1 it was explained that evaporating and condensing water is a major means of redistributing energy around the globe. The evaporation of water that contributes to cyclonic storms normally takes place over an ocean, whereas the condensation may occur a considerable distance away. At the time of evaporation, thermal energy (i.e. sensible heat) is transferred into latent energy that is then carried by the water vapour to the place of condensation where it is released as sensible heat once more. This ‘re-release’ is often referred to as advective energy and may be a large energy source to drive further evaporation.Water supplyAs we saw in Chapter 1, evaporation from the ocean is a major component of the hydrological cycle. However, in terrestrial environments, the available water supply can be from water directly on the sur-face of a lake, river or pond. In this case it is open water evaporation (Eo). When the water is lying within soil the water supply becomes more com-plex. Soil water can evaporate directly, although it is normally only from the near surface. As the water is removed from the surface it sets up a soil moisture gradient that will draw water from deeper in the soil towards the surface, but it must over-come the force of gravity and the withholding force exerted by soil capillaries (see Chapter 6). In addi-tion to this the water may be brought to the surface by plants using osmosis in their rooting system. The way that soil moisture controls the transforma-tion from potential evaporation to actual evapora-tion is complex and will be discussed further later in this chapter.The receiving atmosphereOnce the available water has been transformed into water vapour, using whatever energy source is avail-able, it then must be absorbed into the atmosphere surrounding the surface. This process of diffusion requires that the atmosphere is not already saturated EVAPORATION53
day. Under these circumstances the evaporation from your washing (the available water) is high due to the available energy being high (it is a warm day), and the receiving atmosphere mixes well (it is windy) and is able to absorb much water vapour (the air is dry). On a warm and still day, or a warm and humid day washing does not dry as well (i.e. the evapora-tion rate is low). Understanding evaporation in these terms allows us to think about what the evaporation rate might be for particular atmospheric conditions.the parcel of air moves up into the atmosphere, rather than directly along at the same level, so that there is drier air replacing it. This occurs through turbulent diffusion of the air. There is a greater turbulence asso-ciated with air passing over a rough surface than a smooth one, something that will be returned to in the discussion of evaporation estimation.One way of thinking about evaporation is in terms of a washing line. The best conditions for drying your washing outside are on a warm, dry and windy Figure 3.2 The difference between the actual vapour pressure at 20 °C and the vapour pressure at saturation deﬁnes the vapour pressure deﬁcit.01020304050607080

The inﬂuence of stomata on the transpiration rate is an interesting plant physiological phenomenon. Some plants are very effective at shutting stomata when under water stress, and therefore limit their water usage. The water stress occurs when the vapour pres-sure deﬁcit is high and there is a high evaporative demand. In this situation the stomata within a leaf can be likened to a straw. When you suck hard on a soft straw it creates a pressure differential between the inside and outside and the sides collapse in; therefore you cannot draw air easily through the straw. Stomata can act in a similar manner so that when the evaporative demand is high (sucking water vapour through the stomata) the stomata close down and the transpiration rate decreases. Some plant spe-cies shut their stomata when under evaporative stress (e.g. conifers) while others continue transpiring at high rates when the evaporative demand is high (e.g. many pasture species). The ability of plants to shut their stomata can inﬂuence the overall water budget as their overall evaporation is low. This is illustrated in the case study later in this chapter on using a lysimeter to measure tussock evaporation.Where there is a vegetation canopy the evapora-tion above this surface will be a mixture of transpira-tion, evaporation from the soil and evaporation from wet leaves (canopy interception or interception loss or wet leaf evaporation – see Chapter 4). The relative impor-tance of these three evaporation sources will depend on the degree of vegetation cover and the climate at the site. In tropical rainforests transpiration is the dominant water loss but where there is a seasonal soil water deﬁcit the inﬂuence of canopy interception loss becomes more important. This is illustrated by the data in Table 3.1 which contrasts the water balance for two Pinus radiata forests at different locations in New Zealand (with different climates).Wetland environments are interesting in that there is both open water evaporation and transpira-tion occurring simultaneously. In humid conditions (moist air, no wind) atmospheric demand would be very low because of the high moisture content of the air. However, when the air is dry and/or the wind is blowing dry air in, open water evaporation will be occurring at a high rate, as well as transpiration.Open water evaporationAs is clear from the earlier part of this chapter, open water evaporation (Eo), is the most straightforward case of evaporation. This includes water evaporating from lakes and rivers, but also water intercepted by vegetation, buildings and other surfaces. We will deal with intercepted water and its evaporation in the next chapter, and will concentrate on evapora-tion from water bodies in this section.Thinking back to the fundamental processes dis-cussed at the start of the chapter, it is the tempera-ture of the surface layers of the water body that will control the vaporisation rate (properties of the water body). The condensation rate is controlled by the vapour pressure of the layer of air above the water body, in other words the properties of the receiving atmosphere. This means the vapour pressure deﬁcit, but also the atmospheric mixing as described in the previous section. Evaporation loss from water bodies can be signiﬁcant, particularly in arid environments. Properties of the water body that are important include the surface area, depth and salinity (evapo-ration decreases by 1 per cent for every 1 per cent increase in salinity) (Ward and Robinson 2000).Soil evaporationAlthough the fundamental process and drivers of evaporation from soils are exactly the same as evapo-ration from open water, evaporation from soil is usu-ally less than that from open water, under the same meteorological conditions. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the supply of water is more limited relative to open water. Secondly, for a supply of moisture to be available at the surface, it needs to be transmitted upwards from lower down in the soil proﬁle. As we shall see in Chapter 6, properties of the soil exert strong controls on the movement of water, particularly if the soil is not saturated. Evapo-ration directly from the soil is particularly relevant when considering bare earth, such as ploughed land.Transpiration and total evaporationTranspiration by a plant leads to evaporation from leaves through small holes (stomata) in the leaf. This EVAPORATION55
point to remember about them all is that they are attempting to measure how much water is being evaporated above a surface – a very difﬁcult task.The eddy ﬂuctuation method measures the water vapour above a surface in conjunction with a ver-tical wind speed and temperature proﬁles. These have to be measured at extremely short timescales (e.g. microseconds) to account for eddies in verti-cal wind motion. Consequently, extremely detailed micro-meteorological instrumentation is required with all instruments having a rapid response time. In recent years this has become possible with hot wire anemometers and extremely ﬁne thermistor heads for thermometers. One difﬁculty is that you are necessarily measuring over a very small surface area and it may be difﬁcult to scale up to something of interest to catchment-scale hydrology.The aerodynamic proﬁle (or turbulent transfer) method is based on a detailed knowledge of the energy balance over a surface. The fundamental idea is that by calculating the amount of energy avail-able for evaporation, the actual evaporation rate can be determined. The measurements required are changes in temperature and humidity giving verti-cal humidity gradients. To use this method it must be assumed that the atmosphere is neutral and sta-ble, two conditions that are not always applicable.The Bowen ratio method is similar to the aerody-namic proﬁle method but does not assume as much about the atmospheric conditions. The Bowen ratio is the ratio of sensible heat to latent heat and requires detailed measurement of net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, temperature and humidity gradient above MEASUREMENT OF EVAPORATIONIn the previous chapter there was much emphasis on the difﬁculties of measuring precipitation due to its inherent variability. All these difﬁculties also apply to the measurement of evaporation, but they pale into insigniﬁcance when you consider that now we are dealing with measuring the rate at which a gas (water vapour) moves away from a surface. Con-centrations of gases in the atmosphere are difﬁcult to measure, and certainly there is no gauge that we can use to measure total amounts in the same way that we can for precipitation.In each of the process chapters in this book there is an attempt to distinguish between measurement and estimation techniques. In the case of evapora-tion this distinction becomes extremely blurred. In reality almost all the techniques used to ﬁnd an evaporation rate are estimates, but some are closer to true measurement than others. In this section each technique will include a sub-section on how close to ‘true measurement’ it is.Direct micro-meteorological measurementThere are three main methods used to measure evaporation directly: the eddy ﬂuctuation (or cor-relation), aerodynamic proﬁle, and Bowen ratio methods. These are all micro-meteorological mea-surement techniques and details on them can be found elsewhere (e.g. Oke 1987). An important Table 3.1 Estimated evaporation losses from two Pinus radiata sites in New ZealandPuruki (Central North Island, NZ) (% annual rainfall in brackets)Balmoral (Central South Island, NZ) (% annual rainfall in brackets)Annual rainfall1,405mm870mmAnnual interception loss370mm(26)220mm(25)Annual transpiration705mm(50)255mm(29)Annual soil evaporation95mm(7)210mm(24)Remainder (runoff + percolation)235mm(17)185mm(21)Source: Data adapted from Kelliher and Jackson (2001)56EVAPORATIONthat no seepage or leakage occurs. This eliminates runoff (Q term) from the water balance. Therefore it can be assumed that any change in storage is related to either evaporative loss or precipitation gain. This means that the water balance equation can be rear-ranged as shown in Equation 3.2:E = ΔS – P (3.2)If there is a precipitation gauge immediately adja-cent to the evaporation pan then the P term can be accounted for, leaving only the change in storage (∆S) to be measured as either a weight loss or a drop in water depth. At a standard meteorological station the evaporation is measured daily as the change in water depth. For a ﬁner temporal resolution (e.g. hourly) there are load cell instruments available which mea-sure and record the weight at regular intervals.An evaporation pan is ﬁlled with water, hence you are measuring Eo, the open water evaporation. Although this is useful, there are severe problems with using this value as an indicator of actual evapo-ration (Et) in a catchment. The ﬁrst problem is that E0 will normally be considerably higher than Et because the majority of evaporation in a catchment will be occurring over a land surface where the available water is contained within soil and may be limited. This will lead to a large overestimation of the actual evaporation. This factor is well known and conse-quently evaporation pans are rarely used in catchment water balance studies, although they are useful for estimating water losses from lakes and reservoirs.There are also problems with evaporation pans that make them problematic even for open water evapora-tion estimates. A standard evaporation pan, called a Class A evaporation pan, is 1,207 mm in diameter and 254 mm deep. The size of the pan makes them prone to the ‘edge effect’. As warm air blows across a body of water it absorbs any water vapour evaporated from the surface. Numerous studies have shown that the evaporation rate is far higher near the edge of the water than towards the centre where the air is able to absorb less water vapour (this also applies to land surfaces). The small size of an evaporation pan means that the whole pan is effectively an ‘edge’ and will a surface. These measurements need to be averaged over a 30-minute period to allow the inherent assumptions to apply.All of these micro-meteorological approaches to measuring evaporation use sophisticated instru-ments that are difﬁcult to leave in the open for long periods of time. In addition to this they are restricted in their spatial scope (i.e. they only measure over a small area). With these difﬁculties it is not surpris-ing that they tend to be used at a very small scale, mostly to calibrate estimation techniques (see pp. 58–65). They are accurate in the assessment of an evaporation rate, hence their use as a standard for the calibration of estimation techniques. The real prob-lem for hydrology is that it is not a robust method that can be relied on for long periods of time.Indirect measurement (water balance techniques)Evaporation pansThe most common method for the measurement of evaporation is using an evaporation pan (see Figure 3.3). This is a large pan of water with a water depth measuring instrument or weighing device underneath that allows you to record how much water is lost through evaporation over a time period. This technique is actually a manipulation of the water balance equation, hence the terminology used here of a water balance technique. An evapo-ration pan is constructed from impervious material and the water level is maintained below the top so

This sits above the sur-face (to lessen rain splash) and has either an instrument to record water depth or a continuous weighing device, to measure changes in volume.EVAPORATION57amount is measured. Percolation is necessary so that the lysimeter mimics as closely as possible the soil sur-rounding it; without any it would ﬁll up with water. In the same manner as an evaporation pan it is necessary to measure the precipitation input immediately adja-cent to the lysimeter. Assuming that the only runoff (Q) is through percolation, the water balance equation for a lysimeter is shown in Equation 3.3.E = ΔS – P – Q (3.3)A lysimeter faces similar problems to a rain gauge in that it is attempting to measure the evaporation that would be lost from a surface if the lysimeter were not there. The difference from a rain gauge is that what is contained in the lysimeter should closely match the surrounding plants and soil. Although it is never possible to recreate the soil and plants within a lysimeter perfectly, a close approximation can be made and this represents the best efforts possible to measure evaporation. Although lysimeters poten-tially suffer from the same edge effect as evaporation pans, the ability to match the surrounding vegeta-tion means there is much less of an edge effect.A weighing lysimeter has a weighing device under-neath that allows any change in storage to be moni-tored. This can be an extremely sophisticated device (e.g. Campbell and Murray 1990; Yang et al. 2000); where percolation is measured continuously using the same mechanism for a tipping-bucket rain gauge, weight changes are recorded continuously using a hydraulic pressure gauge, and precipitation is measured simultaneously. A variation on this is to have a series of small weighing lysimeters (such as small buckets) that can be removed and weighed individually every day to provide a record of weight loss. At the same time as weighing, the amount of percolation needs to be recorded. This is a very cheap way of estimating evaporation loss for a study using low technology.Without any instrument to weigh the lysimeter (this is sometimes referred to as a percolation gauge) it must be assumed that the change in soil mois-ture over a period is zero and therefore evaporation equals rainfall minus runoff. This may be a reason-able assumption over a long time period such as a have a higher evaporation rate than a much larger body of water. A second, smaller, problem with evap-oration pans is that the sides, and the water inside, will absorb radiation and warm up quicker than in a much larger lake, providing an extra energy source and greater evaporation rate.To overcome the edge effect, empirical (i.e. derived from measurement) coefﬁcients can be used which link the evaporation pan estimates to larger water body estimates. Doorenbos and Pruitt (1975) give estimates for these coefﬁcients that require extra information on upwind fetch distance, wind run and relative humidity at the pan (Goudie et al. 1994). Grismer et al. (2002) provide empirical rela-tionships linking pan evaporation measurements to potential evapotranspiration, i.e. from a vegetated surface, not open water evaporation.LysimetersA lysimeter takes the same approach to measure-ment as the evaporation pan, the fundamental dif-ference being that a lysimeter is ﬁlled with soil and vegetation as opposed to water (see Figure 3.4). This difference is important, as Et rather than Eo is being indirectly measured. A lysimeter can also be made to blend in with the surrounding land cover, lessen-ing the edge effect described for an evaporation pan.There are many versions of lysimeters in use, but all use some variation of the water balance equation to estimate what the evaporation loss has been. One major difference from an evaporation pan is that a lysimeter allows percolation through the bottom, although the

The cylinder is ﬁlled with soil and vegetation similar to the surroundings.58EVAPORATIONto help in this decision the various advantages and shortcomings of each technique are discussed.ThornthwaiteThornthwaite derived an empirical model (i.e. derived from measurement not theoretical under-standing) linking average air temperature to poten-tial evaporation. This is an inherently sensible link in that we know air temperature is closely linked to both available energy and the ability of air to absorb water vapour.The ﬁrst part of the Thornthwaite estimation technique (Thornthwaite 1944, 1954) derives a monthly heat index (i) for a region based on the aver-age temperature t (°C) for a month (Equation 3.4).it=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟51 514 . (3.4)These terms are then summed to provide an annual heat index I (Equation 3.5).Iij==∑112 (3.5)Thornthwaite then derived an equation to provide evaporation estimates based on a series of observed evaporation measurements (Equation 3.6).PEbtIa=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟1610 (3.6)The a and b terms in this equation can be derived in the following ways. Term b is a correction factor to account for unequal day length between months. Its value can be found by looking up tables based on the latitude of your study site. Term a is calibrated as a cubic function from the I term such as is shown in Equation 3.7.a = 6.7 × 10–7 I3 – 7.7 × 10–5 I2 +  0.018 I + 0.49 (3.7)year where the soil storage will be approximately the same between two winters. An example of this type of lysimeter was the work of Law who investi-gated the effect that trees had on the water balance at Stocks Reservoir in Lancashire, UK (Law 1956; see Case Study on p. 74).A well-planned and executed lysimeter study probably provides the best information on evapora-tion that a hydrologist could ﬁnd. However, it must be remembered that it is not evaporation that is being measured in a lysimeter – it is almost every-thing else in the water balance equation, with an assumption being made that whatever is left must be caused by evaporation. One result of this is that any errors in measurement of precipitation and/or percolation will transfer and possibly magnify into errors of evaporation measurement.ESTIMATION OF EVAPORATIONThe difﬁculties in measuring evaporation using either micro-meteorological instruments (prob-lematic when used over long time periods and at the catchment scale) or water balance techniques (accumulated errors and small scale) have led to much effort being placed on estimating evapora-tion rather than trying to actually measure it. Some of the techniques outlined below are com-plicated and this sometimes leads hydrologists to believe that they are measuring, rather than esti-mating, evaporation. What they are actually doing is taking climatological variables that are known to inﬂuence evaporation and simulating evapora-tion rates from these: an estimation technique. The majority of research efforts in this ﬁeld have been to produce models to estimate evaporation; however, more recently, satellite remote sensing has provided another method of estimating the evaporation ﬂux.The techniques described here represent a range of sophistication and they are certainly not all universally applicable. Almost all of these are concerned with estimating the potential evapora-tion over a land surface. As with most estimation techniques, the hydrologist is required to choose the best techniques for the study situation. In order EVAPORATION59Case studyA LYSIMETER USED TO MEASURE EVAPORATION FROM TUSSOCKA narrow-leafed tussock grass (Chionochloa rigida, commonly called ‘snow’ or ‘tall tussock’) covers large areas of the South Island of New Zealand. A ﬁeld study of a catchment dominated by snow tussock (Pearce et al. 1984) showed high levels of baseﬂow (i.e. high levels of streamﬂow between storm actions). Mark et al. (1980) used a percola-tion gauge under a single tussock plant and esti-mating evaporation, showed that the water balance can show a surplus. They suggested that this may be due to the tussock intercepting fog droplets that are not recorded as rainfall in a standard rain gauge (Figure 3.5). The nature of a tussock leaf (long and narrow with a sharp point), would seem to be con-ducive to fog interception in the same manner as conifers intercept fog. Another interpretation of the Mark et al. (1980) study is that the estimation of evaporation was incorrect. An understanding of the mechanisms leading to high baseﬂow levels is important for a greater understanding of hydro-logical processes leading to streamﬂow.In order to investigate this further, a large lysimeter was set up in two different locations. The lysimeter was 2 m in diameter and con-tained nine mature snow tussock plants in an undisturbed monolith, weighing approximately 8,000 kg. Percolating runoff was measured with a tipping-bucket mechanism and the whole lysim-eter was on a beam balance giving a sensitivity of 0.054 mm (Figure 3.6). The rainfall was measured immediately adjacent to the lysimeter. Campbell and Murray (1990) show that although there were times when fog interception appeared to occur (i.e. the catch in the lysimeter was greater than that in the nearby rain gauge) this only accounted for 1 per cent of the total precipitation. The detailed micro-meteorological measurements showed that the tussock stomatal or canopy resistance term was very high and that the plants had an ability to stop transpiring when the water stress became too high (see earlier discussion on plant physiologi-cal response to evaporative stress). The conclusion from the study was that snow tussocks are conser-vative in their use of water, which would appear to account for the high baseﬂow levels from tussock-covered catchments (Davie et al. 2006).Figure 3.5 Water droplets condensing on the end of tussock leaves during a fog.

60EVAPORATIONIn his original formula, Penman estimated net radiation from empirical estimates of short- and long-wave radiation. The formula given here requires observations of temperature, wind speed, vapour pressure (which can be derived from relative humidity) and net radiation and gives the evaporation in units of mm per day. All of these can be obtained from meteorologi-cal measurement. It is normal to use daily aver-ages for these variables, although Shuttleworth (1988) has suggested that it should not be used for time steps of less than 10 days. There are several different ways of presenting this formula, which makes it difficult to interpret between texts. The main difference is in whether the evaporation is a flux or an absolute rate. In the equation above, terms like ‘net radiation’ have been divided by the amount of energy required to evaporate 1 mm of water (density of water (ρ) multiplied by the latent heat of vaporisation (λ)) to turn them into water equivalents. This means the equation derives an absolute value for evaporation rather than a flux.Penman continued his work to consider the evaporation occurring over a vegetated surface (Penman and Scholfield 1951), while others refined the work (e.g. van Bavel 1966). Part of this refinement was to include a term for aerody-namic resistance (ra) to replace Ea (Equation 3.9). Aerodynamic resistance is a term to account for the way in which the water evaporating off a surface mixes with a potentially drier atmo-sphere above it through turbulent mixing. The rougher the canopy surface the greater degree of turbulent mixing that will occur since air pass-ing over the surface is buffeted around by pro-truding objects. As it is a resistance term, the higher the value, the greater the resistance to mixing; therefore a forest has a lower value of ra than smoother pasture. Some values of aerody-namic resistance for different vegetation types are given in Table 3.2.Substituting the new aerodynamic resistance term into the Penman equation, and presenting the results as a water ﬂux (kg of water per m2 of area), The Thornthwaite technique is extremely useful as potential evaporation can be derived from knowl-edge of average temperature (often readily available from nearby weather stations) and latitude. There are drawbacks to its usage however; most notably that it only provides estimates of monthly evaporation. For anything at a smaller time-scale it is necessary to use another technique such as Penman’s (see below). There are also problems with using Thornthwaite’s model in areas of high potential evaporation. The empirical nature of the model means that it has been calibrated for a certain set of conditions and that it may not be applicable outside these. The Thornth-waite model has been shown to underestimate poten-tial evaporation in arid and semi-arid regions (e.g. Acheampong 1986). If the model is being applied in conditions different to Thornthwaite’s original calibration (humid temperate regions) it is advisable to ﬁnd out if any researcher has published different calibration curves for the climate in question.PenmanPenman was a British physicist who derived a theo-retical model of evaporation. Penman’s ﬁrst theo-retical model was for open water evaporation and is shown in Equations 3.8 and 3.9 (Penman 1948):EQEoa=++∆∆*γγ (3.8)where an empirical relationship states that:Euae=+⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟2611 862..δ (3.9)and Q* =  net radiation (in evaporation equivalent units of mm/day)Δ    =  rate of increase of the saturation vapour deﬁcit with temperature (kPa/°C see Fig-ure 3.6)δe   = vapour pressure deﬁcit of the air (kPa)γ     = psychrometric constant (≈ 0.063 kPa/°C)u    = wind speed at 2 m elevation (m/s)EVAPORATION61andκ    = Von Karman constant (≈ 0.41)u    = wind speed above canopy (m/s)z    = height of anemometer (m)d    =  zero plane displacement (the height within a canopy at which wind speed drops to zero, often estimated at two-thirds of the canopy height) (m)zo    =  roughness length (often estimated at one eighth of vegetation height) (m)Although this formula looks complicated it is actu-ally rather simple. It is possible to split the equa-tion into two separate parts that conform to the understanding of evaporation already discussed. The available energy term is predominantly assessed through the net radiation (Q*) term. Other terms in the equation relate to the ability of the atmo-sphere to absorb the water vapour (Δ, ρ, cρ, δe, λ, γ, this is referred to as the sensible heat transfer func-tion) and the rate at which diffusion will absorb the water vapour into the atmosphere (κ, u, zo, etc.).Figure 3.6 shows the relationship between the saturated vapour pressure and temperature.

Every other term in the equation is either a constant, a simple relationship from another vari-able or can be measured once.

This makes it extremely useful to hydrology and it is probably the most widely used method for estimating potential evaporation values.However, there are problems with the Penman equation which make it less than perfect as an esti-mation technique. The assumption is made that the soil heat ﬂux is unimportant in the evapora-tion energy budget. This is often the case but is an acknowledged simpliﬁcation that may lead to some overall error, especially when the time step is less than one day. It is normal practice to use Penman estimates at the daily time step; however, in some modelling studies they are used at hourly time steps.One major problem with the Penman equa-tion relates to its applicability in a range of situa-tions and in particular in the role of advection, as discussed on p. 51. This is where there are other energy sources available for evaporation that can-not be assessed from net radiation. Calder (1990) shows the results from different studies in the UK uplands where evaporation rates vastly exceed the estimates provided by the Penman equation. The cause of this discrepancy is the extra energy pro-vided by cyclonic storms coming onto Britain from the Atlantic Ocean, something that is poorly accounted for in the Penman equation. The part of the Penman equation dealing with the ability of the atmosphere to absorb the water vapour (sen-sible heat transfer function) does account for some advection but not if it is a major energy source driving evaporation and it is highly sensitive to the aerodynamic resistance term. This does not render the Penman approach invalid; rather, in applying it the user must be sure that net radi-ation is the main source of energy available for evaporation or the aerodynamic resistance term is well understood.Figure 3.7 The relationship between temperature and saturation vapour pressure. This is needed to calculate the rate of increase of saturation vapour pressure with temperature (Δ). Equation 3.12 describes the form of this relationship.

If the canopy resistance is high the actual evaporation rate drops to less than potential. Canopy resistance represents the abil-ity of a vegetation canopy to control the rate of transpiration. This is achieved through the open-ing and closing of stomata within a leaf, hence rc is sometimes referred to as stomatal resistance. Vari-ous researchers have established canopy resistance values for different vegetation types (e.g. Szeicz  et al. 1969), although they are known to vary seasonally and in some cases diurnally. Rowntree (1991) suggests that for grassland under non- limiting moisture conditions, the range of rc should fall somewhere between 60 and 200 s/m. The large range is a reﬂection of canopy resistance being inﬂuenced by a plant’s physiological response to variations in climatological conditions (see earlier discussion of stomatal control p. 54). Some values of canopy resistance for different vegetation types are given in Table 3.2.Reference evaporationThe Penman–Monteith equation is probably the best evapotranspiration estimation method avail-able, and is the method recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). However for widespread use there is a need to have the stomatal resistance and aerodynamic resistance terms mea-sured for a range of canopy covers at different stages of growth. To overcome this, the idea of reference evaporation has been introduced. This is the evapo-ration from a particular vegetation surface and the evaporation rate for another surface is related to this by means of crop coefﬁcients. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) convened a group Simpliﬁcations to PenmanThere have been several attempts made to simplify the Penman equation for widespread use. Slatyer and McIlroy (1961) separated out the evaporation caused by sensible heat and advection from that caused by radiative energy. Priestly and Taylor (1972) derived a simpliﬁed Penman formula for use in the large-scale estimation of evaporation, in the order of ‘several hundred kilometres’ where it can be argued that large-scale advection is not important. Their formula for potential evaporation is shown in Equation 3.13.PEQQG=−()+()αλγ*∆∆ (3.13)where QG is the soil heat ﬂux term (often ignored by Penman but easily included if the measurements are available) and α is the Priestly–T aylor param-eter, all other parameters being as deﬁned earlier. The α term is an approximation of the sensible heat transfer function and was estimated by Priestly and Taylor (1972) to have a value of 1.26 for saturated land surfaces, oceans and lakes – that is to say, the sensible heat transfer accounts for 26 per cent of the evaporation over and above that from net radia-tion. This value of α has been shown to vary away from 1.26 (e.g. α = 1.21 in Clothier et al. 1982) but to generally hold true for large-scale areas with-out a water deﬁcit. The Priestly–Taylor adaptation of the Penman equation is important for regional scale evapotranspiration assessment using satellite remote sensing (see Case Study in the Remote Sens-ing of Evaporation section).Penman–MonteithMonteith (1965) derived a further term for the Penman equation so that actual evaporation from a vegetated surface could be estimated. His work involved adding a canopy resistance term (rc) into the Penman equation so that it takes the form of Equation 3.14.64EVAPORATIONand evapotranspiration of other crops can be related (Allen et al. 1998). Scotter and Heng (2003) have investigated the sensitivity of the different inputs to the reference evaporation equation in order to show what accuracy of measurement is required.Table 3.3 outlines some crop coefﬁcients as set out by FAO (Allen et al. 1998). At the simplest level the evapotranspiration for a particular crop can be estimated by multiplying the crop coefﬁcient with the reference evapotranspiration although there are more complex procedures outlined in Allen et al. (1998) which account for growth throughout a sea-son and climatic variability. Where the crop coef-ﬁcient values shown in Table 3.3 are higher than 1.0 it is likely that the aerodynamic roughness of the canopy makes for higher evaporation rates than for short grass. Where the values are less than 1.0 then the plants are exerting stomatal control on the transpiration rate.Simple estimation of Et from PE and soil moistureWhere there is no stomatal control exerted by plants (e.g. in a pasture) the relationship between actual evaporation (Et) and potential evaporation (PE) is by and large driven by the availability of water. Over a land surface the availability of water can be estimated from the soil moisture content of experts who decided that the best surface for ref-erence evaporation is close-cropped, well-watered grass. This is described in Allen et al. (1998) as a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, a ﬁxed canopy resistance of 70 s/m and an albedo of 0.23.

measured with a neutron probe and vapour pressure deﬁcit was estimated from a nearby meteorological station. At the start of the summer period (October to November 1998) the soil moisture level is high and the transpiration rate climbs rapidly to a peak. Once it has reached the peak, the transpiration rate plateaus, despite the maximum vapour pressure deﬁ-cit continuing to climb. During this plateau in tran-spiration rate the forest is exerting some stomatal control so that the transpiration doesn’t increase by as much as the vapour pressure deﬁcit. From January 1999 (the height of the Southern Hemisphere sum-mer) the transpiration rate drops markedly. Initially this matches a drop in the maximum vapour pressure deﬁcit but the transpiration rate continues to drop below early summer rates (with similar VPD values). This is the time that the lack of soil moisture is start-ing to limit the tree transpiration. Figure 3.11 illus-trates the complex relationship between evaporation from a vegetated surface, the soil moisture conditions and the atmospheric conditions.Remote sensing of evaporationWater vapour is a greenhouse gas and therefore it interferes with radiation (i.e. absorbs and reradiates) from the earth’s surface. Because of this the amount (see Chapter 4). At a simple level it is possible to estimate the relationship between potential and actual evaporation using soil moisture content as a measured variable (see Figure 3.10). In Figure 3.10 a value of 1 on the y-axis corresponds to actual precipitation equalling potential evaporation (i.e. available water is not a limiting factor on the evapo-ration rate). The exact position where this occurs will be dependent on the type of soil and plants on the land surface, hence the lack of units shown on the x-axis and the two different curves drawn. This type of simple relationship has been effective in determining actual evaporation rates in a model of soil water budgeting (e.g. Davie et al. 2001) but cannot be relied on for accurate modelling studies. It provides a very crude estimate of actual evapora-tion from knowledge of soil moisture and potential evaporation.The relationship between actual evaporation and soil moisture is not so simple where there is a vegeta-tion type that exerts stomatal control on the evapo-ration rate (e.g. coniferous forest). In this case the amount of evaporation will be related to both soil moisture (available water) and the vapour pressure deﬁcit (ability of the atmosphere to absorb water vapour). This is illustrated by Figure 3.11, a time series of soil moisture, transpiration and vapour pressure deﬁcit for a stand of Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Transpiration was measured using sap-ﬂow meters on a range of trees; soil moisture was

66EVAPORATION(SVAT) model that is driven by remotely sensed data. This type of approach can be used to estimate evaporation rates over a large spatial area relatively easily. Mauser and Schädlich (1998) provide a review of evaporation modelling at different scales using remotely sensed data, while Zhang et al. (2016) provide a review of more recent develop-ments. The Case Study below gives a more contem-porary example of the use of remotely sensed data in estimating global evaporation.of water vapour in the atmosphere can be estimated using satellite remote sensing, particularly using passive microwave sensors. The difﬁculty with using this information for hydrology is that it is at a very large scale (often continental) and is concerned with the whole atmosphere, not the near surface. In order to utilise satellites for estimation of evapo-ration, a combined modelling and remote sensing approach is required. Burke et al. (1997) describe a combined Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere–Transfer Case studySATELLITE REMOTE SENSING OF EVAPORATIONGLEAM (Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model) is a good example of trying to harness the maximum potential of satellite-derived data, using a variety of satellite sensor products. First developed in 2011 (Miralles et al. 2011), it has been successively revised and at the time of writ-ing a third version (GLEAM v3) was available (Martens et al. 2017) (see below for a summary of the datasets that have emerged from each version). GLEAM is a set of algorithms that individually estimate each of the components of evaporation from land. These are open water evaporation and sublimation (from snow and ice), transpiration and bare earth evaporation, and interception loss.GLEAM uses the Priestly–Taylor equation (refer back to the Simpliﬁcations to Penman sec-tion of this chapter) to calculate potential evapo-ration for water bodies and areas covered by ice and snow because most of the required data can be directly observed by satellites. The data required for this are observations of surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature, both of which can be measured by satellites such as NASA’s Terra and Aqua. The Priestly–Taylor equation is also used for calculating evaporation from areas of bare soil and land covered by vegetation; in the case of the latter, this is for two categories of vegetation (tall canopy and short canopy). As you will know from the earlier part of this chapter, for vegetated areas potential evaporation needs to be converted to actual evaporation, which in turn depends on vegetation and the soil mois-ture available to these plants. In GLEAM, this is done by integrating two datasets, both of which originate from the European Space Agency’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The ﬁrst is the microwave-based Vegetation Opti-cal Depth and the second is an estimate of soil moisture. Flux in soil moisture is modelled sepa-rately in another set of algorithms in GLEAM (the soil module), which has a multi-layer repre-sentation of the soil proﬁle and is driven by pre-cipitation derived from several other satellites. To minimise errors in this modelling process, the SMOS moisture observations are also assimi-lated into the model. Another set of algorithms (stress module) contains semi-empirical relation-ships relating stress and soil moisture condition in the root zone for vegetation characterised by the Vegetation Optical Depth. These determine the stress factor to convert potential evaporation into actual evaporation. The last of the evapora-tion components mentioned at the start of this case study, interception loss, assesses evapora-tion directly off the surface of vegetation after it has been intercepted during rainfall (Chapter 4 "
3,"The water balance equation, explained in Chap-ter 1, contains a storage term (S). Within the global hydrological cycle there are several areas where water can be considered to be stored, most notably soil moisture, groundwater, snow and ice and, to a lesser extent, lakes and reservoirs. It is tempting to see stored water as static, but in reality there is con-siderable movement involved. The use of a storage term is explained in Figure 4.1 where it can be seen that there is an inﬂow, an outﬂow and a movement of water between the two. The inﬂow and outﬂow do not have to be equal over a time period; if not, then there has been a change in storage (ΔS). The critical point is that at all times there is some water stored, even if it is not the same water throughout a measurement period.This deﬁnition of stored water is not perfect as it could include rivers as stored water in addition to groundwater, etc. The distinction is often made based on ﬂow rates (i.e. how quickly the water moves while in storage). There is no critical limit to say when a deep, slow river becomes a lake, and likewise there is no deﬁnition of how slow the ﬂow has to be before becoming stored water. It relies on an intuitive judgement that slow ﬂow rates consti-tute stored water.The importance of stored water is highlighted by the fact that it is by far the largest amount LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of the importance of surface storage, particularly in relation to storage by snow and ice. /H17039A knowledge of how storage in snow and ice is measured and estimated. /H17039An understanding of the processes of precipitation interception by vegetation. /H17039An understanding of the techniques for estimating interception loss and measuring other processes involved in interception. /H17039An understanding of depression storage as an initial abstraction.4INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGE70INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGEatmosphere, thereby contributing to interception loss. Secondly, it can be held in the canopy until it is dislodged by wind or drips off leaves, eventu-ally falling to the ground, in which case it is called throughfall. Finally, it can run down the stems of leaves and branches towards the trunk, and ulti-mately into the ground at the base of the trunk, and this is called stemﬂow. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2, and can happen at a forest canopy, at the level of shrubs or grass, and even on a litter layer. Figure 4.3 represents this as a systems dia-gram, showing the ﬂuxes and storages involved in these processes.of fresh water in or around planet earth (see Table 1.2, p. 8). The majority of this is as surface storage – either in snow and ice (particularly the polar ice caps) or groundwater (sub-surface stor-age). For many parts of the world, groundwater is a major source of drinking water, so knowledge of amounts and replenishment rates is important for water resource management (see Chapter 5). By deﬁnition, stored water is slow moving so it is particularly prone to contamination by pollutants. The three ‘Ds’ of water pollution control (dilu-tion, dispersion and degradation; see Chapter 10) all occur at slow rates in stored water, making pol-lution management a particular problem. When this is combined with the use of these waters for potable supply, an understanding of the hydro-logical processes occurring in stored water is very important.In this chapter we will focus on surface storage by snow and ice, the other two major sub-surface stores in the soil zone and in groundwater will be discussed in the following two chapters. This chapter will also consider the process of intercep-tion and interception storage and loss, as well as depression storage, and we will start with these processes.INTERCEPTIONInterception refers to the process whereby the fall of precipitation to the ground is ‘intercepted’ or interrupted by being caught by vegetation. One of three things can happen to precipitation caught in this way. Firstly, it can be evaporated back into the

the interception store. The canopy storage capac-ity is controlled by the size of trees, plus the area and water-holding capacity of individual leaves. The latter would be inﬂuenced by factors such as the shape, orientation, roughness, and ﬂexibility of leaves, including features such as the presence of ﬁne hairs. Seasonality is important too, as canopy storage would vary between trees that shed their leaves in winter (deciduous) and evergreen trees.Although vegetation characteristics are impor-tant in understanding interception, climatic factors are equally important including rainfall rate, wind and evaporative demand. For example, rainfall characteristics are an important control on indirect throughfall as they dictate how quickly the canopy storage capacity is ﬁlled. Referring back to the earlier analogy of standing under a tree during a rainstorm, experience should tell you that intensive rainfall quickly turns into indirect throughfall (i.e. you get wet!), whereas light showers frequently do not reach the ground surface at all.In reality, canopy storage capacity is a rather neb-ulous concept. Canopy characteristics are constantly ThroughfallThis is the water that falls to the ground either directly, through gaps in the canopy (direct through-fall), or indirectly, having dripped off leaves, stems or branches (indirect throughfall). The amount of direct throughfall is controlled by the canopy cov-erage for an area, a measure of which is the leaf area index (LAI). LAI is the ratio of leaf area to ground surface area and consequently has a value greater than one when there is more than one layer of leaf above the ground. When the LAI is less than one you would expect some direct throughfall to occur. When you shelter under a tree during a rain-storm you are trying to avoid the rainfall and direct throughfall. The greater the surface area of leaves above you, the more likely it is that you will avoid getting wet from direct throughfall.The amount of indirect throughfall is also con-trolled by the LAI, in addition to the canopy storage capacity and the rainfall characteristics. Canopy storage capacity is the volume of water that can be held by the canopy before water starts drip-ping as indirect throughfall, referred to by some as RainfallRain not interceptedRain on canopyFlow to trunkInterception lossTrunk evaporationCanopy evaporation

This is counter to the majority of catchment studies reported by Bosch and Hewlett (1982) which show an increase in water yield as forests are logged. The reason for the loss of water with the corresponding loss of trees in Oregon is to do with the particular circum-stances of the catchment. Fog from the cold North Paciﬁc, with no accompanying rain, is a common feature and the trees intercept fog particles, cre-ating ‘fog drip’ which is a signiﬁcant part of the water balance. Fog droplets are extremely small, and Ingwersen (1985) has suggested that the sharp ends of needles on pine trees act as condensation nuclei, promoting the growth of larger droplets that fall to the ground (see an example of fogdrip from tussock leaves in Figure 3.5). When the trees are removed there are no condensation nuclei (or far fewer) on the resultant vegetation so the water remains in the atmosphere and is ‘lost’ in terms of water yield. Equally important is the inﬂuence of vegetation roughness. The turbulent mixing of air as wind passes over a rough canopy promotes rapid deposition of condensing water (directly converse to interception loss; see Chapter 3). The overall result of this is that the removal of trees in the Oregon case leads to less water in the river; this runs coun-ter to the evidence provided in the Maimai Case Study in Chapter 7.It is the role of interception loss (wet leaf evapo-ration) that makes afforested areas greater users of water than pasture land (see Case Study on p. 74). This is because the transpiration rates are similar between pasture and forest, but the interception loss is far greater from a forested area. There are two inﬂuences on the amount of interception loss from a particular site: canopy structure and meteorology.Canopy structural factors include the storage capac-ity, the drainage characteristics of the canopy and the aerodynamic roughness of the canopy. The mor-phology of leaf and bark on a tree are important factors in controlling how quickly water drains towards the soil. If leaves are pointed upwards changing and it is rare for water on a canopy to ﬁll up completely before creating indirect throughfall. This means that indirect throughfall occurs before the amount of rainfall equals the canopy storage capacity, making it difﬁcult to gauge exactly what the storage capacity is.StemﬂowStemﬂow is the rainfall that is intercepted by stems and branches and ﬂows down the tree trunk into the soil. Although measurements of stemﬂow show that it is a small part of the hydrological cycle (nor-mally 2–10 per cent of above canopy rainfall (Lee 1980)) it can have a much more signiﬁcant role. Durocher (1990) found that trees with smoother bark such as beech (Fagus) had higher rates of stem-ﬂow as the smoothness of bark tends to enhance drainage towards stemﬂow.Stemﬂow acts like a funnel, collecting water from a large area of canopy but delivering it to the soil in a much smaller area: the surface of the trunk at the base of a tree. This is most obvious when consider-ing large canopy leafy trees, but it still applies for other structures (e.g. conifers) where the area of stem-ﬂow entry into the soil is far smaller than the canopy catchment area for rainfall. At the base of a tree it is possible for the water to rapidly enter the soil through ﬂow along roots and other macropores surrounding the root structure. This can act as a rapid conduit of water sending a signiﬁcant pulse into the soil water.Interception lossWhile water sits on the canopy, prior to indirect throughfall or stemﬂow, it is available for evaporation. When this evaporation occurs, this is known as intercep-tion loss. You will recall this was mentioned brieﬂy in the previous chapter, and also in the Case Study on the use of remote sensing for the estimation of evaporation.Interception gainIn some circumstances it is possible that there is an interception gain from vegetation. In the Bull INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGE73
important will be the frequency of rainfall. Does the canopy have time to dry out between rain events? If so, then the interception amount is likely to be higher. This is demonstrated in Figure 4.5 where the percentage of interception loss (intercep-tion ratio – broken line) is higher for small daily rainfall totals and the actual interception amount then there tends to be a rapid drainage of water towards the stem. Sometimes this appears as an evo-lutionary strategy by a plant in order to harvest as much water as possible (e.g. rhubarb and gunnera plants). Large broadleaved plants, such as oak (Quer-cus), tend to hold water well on their leaves, while needled plants can hold less per leaf (although they normally have more leaves). Seasonal changes make a large difference within deciduous forests, with far greater interception losses when the trees have leaves than without. Table 4.1 illustrates the inﬂuence of plant morphology through the varia-tion in interception found in different forest types and ages.The largest inﬂuence that a canopy has in the evaporation process is through the aerodynamic roughness of the top of the canopy. This means that as air passes over the canopy it creates a turbulent ﬂow that is very effective at moving evaporated water away from the surface. The reason that forests have such high interception losses is because they have a lot of intercepting surfaces and they have a high aerodynamic roughness leading to high rates of diffusion of the evaporated water away from the leaf (Figure 4.4).Meteorological factors affecting the amount of interception loss are the rainfall characteristics. The rate at which rainfall occurs (intensity) and storm duration are critical in controlling the intercep-tion loss. The longer water stays on the canopy the greater the amount of interception loss.

The interception ratio ranges from 0.45 at 500 mm annual rainfall, to 0.27 at 2,700 mm annual rainfall. It is important to note that these interception ratio ﬁgures have considerable inter-annual variability.(solid line) reaches a maximum value of around 7 mm even in the largest of daily rainfalls.The amount of interception loss from an area is climate dependent. Calder (1990) used an amalga-mation of different UK forest interception studies to show that there is a higher interception ratio (the Case studyFORESTS AND RAINFALL VS EVAPORATIONIf you stand watching a forest during a warm summer shower it is common enough to see what appear to be clouds forming above the trees. For many years it was believed that somehow trees attract rainfall and that cloud-forming was evi-dence of this phenomenon. As described by Pereira (1989) ‘The worldwide evidence that hills and mountains usually have more rainfall and more natural forests than do adjacent low-lands has historically led to confusion of cause and effect’. This idea was taken further so that it became common practice to have forestry as a major land use in catchments that were being used to collect water for potable supply. In fact, the cloud formation that is visible above a forest is a result of evaporation occurring from water sit-ting on the vegetation (intercepted rainfall). This ‘wet leaf evaporation’ can be perceived as a loss to the hydrologist as it does not reach the soil surface and contribute to possible streamﬂow. Through-out the latter half of the twentieth century there was considerable debate on how important wet leaf evaporation is.One of the ﬁrst pieces of ﬁeld research to promote the idea of canopy interception being important was undertaken at Stocks Reservoir, Lancashire, UK. Law (1956) studied the water balance of an area covered with conifers (Sitka spruce) and com-pared this to a similar area covered with grassland. The water balance was evaluated for areas isolated by impermeable barriers with evaporation left as the residual (i.e. rainfall and runoff were measured and soil moisture assumed constant by looking at annual totals). Law found that the evaporation from the forested area was far greater than that for the pasture and he speculated that this was caused by wet leaf evaporation – in particular that the wet leaf evaporation was far greater from the for-ested area as there was a greater storage capacity for the intercepted water. Furthermore, Law went on to calculate the amount of water ‘lost’ to reser-voirs through wet leaf vegetation and suggested a compensation payment from the forestry owners to water suppliers.Conventional hydrological theory at the time suggested that wet leaf evaporation was not an important part of the hydrological cycle because it compensated for the reduction in transpiration that occurred at the same time (e.g. Leyton and Carlisle 1959; Penman 1963). In essence it was believed that the evapotranspiration rate stayed constant whether the canopy was wet or dry.Following the work of Law, considerable research effort was directed towards discovering whether the wet leaf/dry leaf explanation was responsible for discrepancies in the water bal-ance between grassland and forest catchments. Rutter (1967) and Stewart (1977) found that wet leaf evaporation in forests may be up to three or four times that from dry leaf. In contrast to this, other work has shown that on grassland, wet leaf evaporation is approximately equal to dry leaf ( McMillan and Burgy 1960; McIlroy and Angus 1964). In addition, transpiration rates for pasture INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGE75
large enough to avoid obstruction from nearby trees (see Figure 2.10).ThroughfallThroughfall is the hardest part of the forest hydro-logical cycle to measure. This is because a forest canopy is normally variable in density and there-fore throughfall is spatially heterogeneous. One common method is to place numerous rain gauges on the forest ﬂoor in a random manner. If you are interested in a long-term study then it is reasonable to keep the throughfall gauges in ﬁxed positions. However, if the study is investigating individual storm events then it is considered best practice to move the gauges to new random positions between storm events. In this way the throughfall catch should not be inﬂuenced by gauge position. To derive an average throughfall ﬁgure it is necessary to come up with a spatial average in the same man-ner as for areal rainfall estimates.To overcome the difﬁculty of a small sampling area (rain gauge) measuring something notoriously variable (throughfall), some investigators have used either troughs or plastic sheeting. Troughs collect over a greater area and have proved to be very effec-tive (see Figure 4.6). Plastic sheeting is the ultimate way of collecting throughfall over a large area, but has several inherent difﬁculties. The ﬁrst is purely logistical in that it is difﬁcult to install and main-tain, particularly to make sure there are no rips. The Interception measurementThe most common method of assessing the amount of canopy interception loss is to measure the precip-itation above and below a canopy and assume that the difference is from interception. Stated in this way it sounds a relatively simple task but in real-ity it is fraught with difﬁculty and error. Durocher (1990) provides a good example of the instrumen-tation necessary to measure canopy interception, in this case for a deciduous woodland plot.Above-canopy precipitationTo measure above-canopy precipitation, a rain gauge may be placed on a tower above the canopy. The usual rain gauge errors apply here, but espe-cially the exposure to the wind. As described earlier in this chapter, the top of a forest canopy tends to be rough and is very good for allowing turbulent transfer of evaporated water. The turbulent air is not so good for measuring rainfall! An additional problem for any long-term study is that the canopy is not static; the tower needs to be raised every year so that it remains above the growing canopy.One way around the tower problem is to place a rain gauge in a nearby clearing and assume that what falls there is the same amount as directly above the canopy nearby. This is often perfectly rea-sonable to assume, particularly for long-term totals, but care must be taken to ensure the clearing is have been found to be similar to that of forested areas. When all this evidence is added up it con-ﬁrms Law’s work that forested areas ‘lose’ more rainfall through evaporation of intercepted water than grassland areas.However, there is still a question over whether the increased wet leaf evaporation may lead to a higher regional rainfall – a form of water recy-cling. Bands et al. (1987) write that: ‘Forests are associated with high rainfall, cool slopes or moist areas. There is some evidence that, on a continental scale, forests may form part of a hydrological feed-back loop with evaporation contributing to fur-ther rainfall’. Most researchers conclude that in general there is little, if any, evidence that forests can increase rainfall. However, Calder (1999: 24, 26) concludes, ‘Although the effects of forests on rainfall are likely to be relatively small, they can-not be totally dismissed from a water resources perspective. . . . Further research is required to determine the magnitude of the effect, particu-larly at the regional scale.’76INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGEwhat eventually reaches the ground – so that you can then infer the difference as being the part of the interception storage that was lost via evaporation. As you can imagine, each vegetation type will have its own particular challenges in measurement, and in many types this will vary seasonally. For this reason, empirical studies reported in the literature will focus on a particular type of vegetation. Because of their importance and also because of the signiﬁcance of interception in the local hydrology of forested areas, most work in this area has been on forests.Early estimation approaches were based on simple regression type methods which linked interception loss to falling precipitation, while Horton (1919) proposed interception loss would be comprised of the intercepted rain evaporated during the storm plus that remaining after the storm, and which would later evaporate (Robinson and Ward 2017). Empirical models that link rainfall to interception loss based on regression relationships of measured data sets have been developed for many different types of vegetation canopy (see Zinke (1967) and Massman (1983) for examples and reviews of these types of model). Some of these models used loga-rithmic or exponential terms in the equations but they all rely on having regression coefﬁcients based on the vegetation type and climatic regime.A more detailed modelling approach is the Rutter model (Rutter et al. 1971, 1975) which calculates an hourly water balance within a forest stand. The water balance is calculated, taking into account the rate of throughfall, stemﬂow, interception loss through evap-oration and canopy storage. In order to use the model, a detailed knowledge of the canopy characteristics is required. In particular the canopy storage and drain-age rates from throughfall are required to be known; the best method for deriving these is through empiri-cal measurement. The Rutter model treats the canopy as a single large leaf, although it has been adapted to provide a three-dimensional canopy (e.g. Davie and Durocher 1997) that can then be altered to allow for changes and growth in the canopy. Because the Rutter model operates on a short time-step, requires much data and is complex to use, it is generally only used in a research context (Robinson and Ward 2017).second is that by having an impervious layer above the ground there is no, or very little, water entering the soil. This might not be a problem for a short-term study but is over the longer term, especially if the investigator is interested in the total water bud-get. It may also place the trees under stress through lack of water, thus leading to an altered canopy.StemﬂowThe normal method of measuring stemﬂow is to place collars around a tree trunk that capture all the water ﬂowing down the trunk. On trees with smooth bark this may be relatively simple but is very difﬁcult on rough bark such as found on many conifers. It is important that the collars are sealed to the tree so that no water can ﬂow underneath and that they are large enough to hold all the water ﬂowing down the trunk. The collars should be sloped to one side so that the water can be collected or measured in a tipping-bucket rain gauge. Maintenance of the collars is very important as they easily clog up or become appropri-ate resting places for forest fauna such as slugs!Interception estimationAs is evident from the preceding section, measure-ment of interception is very challenging. Firstly, there are the challenges in measuring above canopy rainfall and secondly there are the problems in measuring Figure 4.6 Throughfall troughs sitting beneath a pine tree canopy. This collects rain falling through the canopy over the area of the trough. It is sloping so that water ﬂows to a collection point.
INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGE77Jia (2014) have developed a remote sensing Gash model (RS-Gash) where remote sensing observa-tions of Vegetation Area Index (VAI) and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) were used to assess inter-ception loss from heterogeneous forest at a regional scale in the Heihe river basin, China. Comparison with ground measurements showed reasonable accuracy in estimation, providing further evidence that the Gash model can be used successfully at a regional scale. Interception loss is of course a com-ponent of the evaporation budget, and as noted in the Case Study on remote sensing of evaporation (p. 66), the GLEAM model for estimating global evaporation (Martens et al. 2017) uses the Gash model implemented in using the same approach presented in Miralles et al. (2011).DEPRESSION STORAGEWhile the preceding section has focused on inter-ception by vegetation, precipitation can also be intercepted and stored by other surfaces. Consider for example, the numerous ﬂat impervious surfaces in an urban environment. If precipitation here is not drained effectively it will be stored and sub-ject to evaporation. This is not limited to the urban environment either; there are many other places where precipitation may be held on the surface. In agricultural landscapes, for example, water will pond in small depressions. Although some might inﬁltrate the soil, where soils are compacted or sur-face crusting has occurred this will be limited and stored water will be subject to evaporation. Know-ing something about these storages (and potential losses) is important as they inﬂuence the proportion of precipitation that eventually becomes runoff.SNOW AND ICE STORAGEThe parts of the earth’s surface where water exists in solid form (sea, lake and river ice, glaciers, snow cover, ice caps, ice sheets and frozen ground) is known as the cryosphere. Snow and ice are hugely important stores of water for many countries in the world, particularly A simpliﬁed approach which retains much of the correct process representation of the Rutter model was proposed by Gash (1979). This method distin-guishes between the vegetation and meteorological factors controlling interception and calculates inter-ception for each storm event. Subsequent empirical testing found that both the Gash and Rutter methods overestimated for sparser canopies in temperate areas leading to the reformulated Gash model (Gash et al. 1995) which is now the most widely implemented approach (Muzylo et al. 2009). The latter authors provide a useful review of interception modelling.Although remote sensing techniques can provide useful information that can be incorporated into canopy interception models, these methods cannot provide the detailed difference between above- and below-canopy rainfall. The value of remote sensing is that satellites can give good information on the type of vegetation and its degree of cover. However, particular care needs to be taken over the term ‘leaf area index’ (LAI) when reading remote sensing lit-erature. Analysis of remotely sensed images can pro-vide a good indication of the percentage vegetation cover for an area, but this is not necessarily the same as leaf area index – although it is sometimes referred to as such. Leaf area index is the surface area of leaf cover above a deﬁned area divided by the surface area deﬁned. As there are frequently layers of vegetation above the ground, the leaf area index frequently has a value higher than one. The percentage vegetation cover cannot exceed one (as a unitary percentage) as it does not consider the third dimension (height).Nevertheless as both satellite sensor technology and analytical methods develop, we can expect to see progress in the estimation of interception by remote sensing methods. For example, Miralles et al. (2011) produced the ﬁrst global estimate of cumulative rainfall interception over a 5-year period (2003–2007), giving some insight into both the spatial variability and magnitude of forest interception at a global scale. This method adapted the Gash model and used satellite derived pre-cipitation, land cover and lightning frequency (to identify where higher intensity rainfall was occur-ring) in deriving estimates. More recently, Cui and 78INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGEsnow and ice may occur in the headwaters of a river before it has cleared further downstream (at higher latitudes). This may lead to a build-up of water behind the snow and ice further downstream – a snow and ice dam (see Figure 4.7). Beltaos (2000) estimates that the cost of damage caused by ice-jams in Canada is around $60 million dollars per annum. The Case Study below gives an example of the ﬂow regime that may result from this type of snow melt event.at high latitudes or where there are large mountain ranges. The gradual release of water from snow and ice (glaciers), either during spring and summer or on reaching a lower elevation, makes a signiﬁcant impact on the hydrology of many river systems.In the same manner that rainfall may be inter-cepted by a canopy, so can snow. The difference between the two is in the mass of water held and the duration of storage (Lundberg and Halldin 2001). The amount of intercepted snow is frequently much higher than for rainwater and it is held for much longer. This may be available for evaporation through sublimation (moving directly from a solid to a gas) or release later in snow melt. Hedstrom and Pomeroy (1998) point out that the mass of snow held by interception is controlled by the tree branching structure, leaf area and tree species. In countries such as Canada and Russia there are exten-sive forests in regions dominated by winter snow-fall. Some studies have shown as much as 20–50 per cent of gross precipitation being intercepted and evaporated (Lundberg and Halldin 2001). These ﬁgures indicate that a consideration of snowfall interception is critical in these regions. Lundberg and Halldin (2001) provide a review of measuring snow interception and modelling techniques.The timing of snow and ice melt is critical in many river systems, but especially so in rivers that ﬂow north towards the Arctic Circle. In this case the melting of

In North Amer-ica the Missouri/Mississippi system drains south, the Great Lakes/Hudson system drains eastwards, and the Mackenzie river system drains northwards with its mouth in the Beaufort Sea (part of the Arctic Ocean). The Mackenzie river itself has a length of 1,800 km from its source: the Great Slave Lake. The Peace and Athabasca rivers which ﬂow into the Great Slave Lake, and are therefore part of the total Mackenzie drainage basin, begin in the Rocky Mountains 1,000 km to the south-west. The total drainage basin is approximately 1,841,000 km2, making it the twelfth largest in the world, and the river length is 4,250 km (see Figure 4.8).Figure 4.8 Location of the Mackenzie river in Canada.
80INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGEThe high latitude of the Mackenzie river makes for a large component of snow and ice melt within the annual hydrograph. This can be seen in Figure 4.9, taken at the junction of the Mackenzie and Arctic Red rivers. This gaug-ing station is well within the Arctic circle and towards the delta of the Mackenzie river. The monthly discharge values increase dramatically from April to June when the main melt occurs and then gradually decrease to reach a minimum value during the winter months. The highest average streamﬂow occurs in June despite the highest precipitation occurring one month later in July. Overall there is very little variation in precipitation but a huge variation on riverﬂow. This is an excellent example of the storage capa-bility of snow and ice within a river catchment. Any water falling during the winter months is trapped in a solid form (snow or ice) and may be released only during the warmer summer months. The amount of precipitation falling during the summer months (mostly rainfall) is dwarfed by the amount of water released in the melt during May and June.The most remarkable feature of a river sys-tem such as the Mackenzie is that the melt starts occurring in the upper reaches, sending a pulse of water down the river, before ice on the lower reaches has melted properly. This is not unique to the Mackenzie river, all the great rivers draining northwards in Europe, Asia and North America exhibit the same tendencies. If we look in detail at an individual year (Figure 4.10), you can see the difference in daily hydrographs for stations moving down the river (i.e. northwards).

ground. When connected to a continuous logging device a snow pillow provides the best record of snow depth (and water equivalent mass).Estimating snow coverThe main method of estimating snow cover is using satellite remote sensing. Techniques exist that give a reasonably good method of detecting the areal extent of snow cover, but it is much harder to trans-late this into a volume of snow (i.e. by knowing depth) or water. Optical and thermal infrared data can be used to estimate snow cover but they rely heavily on the reﬂective ability of snow; unfor-tunately, other surfaces such as clouds may also exhibit these properties (Fitzharris and McAlevey 1999). Microwave data offer a far better method of detecting snow cover. Passive microwaves detected by a satellite can be interpreted to give snow cover because any water (or snow) covering the surface absorbs some of the microwaves emitted by the earth surface. The greater the amount of snow the weaker is the microwave signal received by the Measuring snow depthThe simplest method of measuring snow depth is the use of a core sampler. This takes a core of snow, recording its depth. The snow sample can then be melted to derive the water equivalent depth, the measurement of most importance in hydrology. The major drawbacks in using a core sampler to derive snow depth are that it is a non-continuous reading (similar to daily rainfall measurement) and the position of coring may be critical (because of snow drifting).A second method of measuring snow depth is to use a snow pillow. This is a sealed plastic pillow that is normally ﬁlled with some form of antifreeze and connected to a pressure transducer (Figure 4.12). When left out over a winter period the weight of snow on top of the pillow is recorded as an increas-ing pressure, which can be recalculated into a mass of snow. It is important that the snow pillow does not create an obstacle to drifting snow in its own right. To overcome this, and to lessen the impact of freezing on the pillow liquid, it is often bur-ied under a shallow layer of soil or laid ﬂat on the ﬂow characteristics for the Mackenzie. It is not a simple story to decipher (as is often the case in hydrology), but you can clearly see that the rise in discharge at the Arctic Red River station starts later than the Norman Wells station further to the south. The rise is caused by melt, but pre-dominantly from upstream. It is also clear that for both Norman Wells and the Arctic Red River stations the highest discharge value of the year is occurring while the river is still covered in ice. This creates huge problems for the drainage of the area as the water may build up behind an ice dam. Certainly, the water ﬂowing under the ice will be moving much quicker than the ice and water mix at the surface. Figure 4.11 demonstrates the way that water builds up behind an ice dam, particu-larly where there is a constriction on either side of the river channel.Figure 4.11 Ice dam forming on the Mackenzie river, Canada.Source: Photograph courtesy of Dr Faye Hicks, University of Alberta
82INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGE
Ferguson (1999) gives an earlier summary of snow melt modelling work. The models can be loosely divided into those that rely on air temperature and those that rely on the amount of radiation at a surface. The former frequently use a degree days approach, the difference between mean daily temperature and a melting threshold temperature. Although it would seem sensible to treat zero as the melting threshold temperature this is not always the case; snow will melt with the air tem-perature less than zero because of energy available through the soil (soil heat ﬂux) and solar radiation. The degree day snow melt approach calibrates the amount of snow that might be expected given a certain value of degree day. Although this is use-ful for hydrological studies it is often difﬁcult to calibrate the model without detailed snow melt data. More recently, Clark et al. (2011) review approaches to representing snow inputs in hydro-logical and land-surface models, which are strongly dependent on the spatial scale at which processes are being represented.satellite. Ranzi et al. (1999) have used AVHRR imagery to monitor the snowpack in an area of northern Italy and some of Switzerland and com-pared this to other measurement techniques. Earlier passive microwave satellite sensors (e.g. AVHRR) were at an extremely coarse spatial resolution that is really only applicable at the large catchment scale. Active microwave sensing offers more hope but its usage for detecting snow cover is still being devel-oped (see Case Study). Dietz et al. (2012) give a detailed review of remote sensing of snow, includ-ing spatial and temporal resolution of sensors and processing algorithms. Frei (2012) provides a useful review of global satellite derived snow products.Snow meltOf critical importance to hydrology is the tim-ing of snow melt, as this is when the stored water is becoming available water. There are numerous models that have been developed to try and esti-mate the amount of snow melt that will occur.

Case studyUSING REMOTELY SENSED DATA TO MONITOR STORAGE IN SNOW AND ICEThe use of satellite imagery and passive remote sensing (RS) to monitor surface water, snow and ice is well established, starting in 1970s with the inclusion of non-visible spectral bands in the early LandSat Multispectral Scanner. Charac-teristic reﬂectances of snow, ice and water were INTERCEPTION AND SURFACE STORAGE83identiﬁed in laboratory studies and it was hoped this information would inform the image inter-pretation process for identifying such features. Unfortunately, the initial optimism about such approaches remained largely unrealised in prac-tice, as the complexity and variability of the real world introduced elements of both doubt and error into the products of image interpretation. However, this does not mean that modern RS techniques have no value – the science has pro-gressed signiﬁcantly in the 30 years since the launch of LandSat-1 in 1978 – but rather that a cautious, and meticulously documented approach to RS products and their use is needed.Identifying ice and snowEstimates of volume of water in surface ice and snow are important in streamﬂow and water stor-age forecasting, which in turn, affects things like hydroelectric power generation potential and irrigation programmes, and many other activities that have an economic impact.One of the problems with RS approaches to identifying ice and snow, is separating these fea-tures spectrally from cloud. However, there are characteristics that do distinguish them from clouds, particularly, higher absorption in the  middle-infrared. What is problematic, though, is that the reﬂectance of both snow and ice changes in different conditions, for example, the high reﬂectance of fresh snow (think bright white) decreases as the snow ages, and characteristics such as density, particle size, the amount of liquid water, and impurity levels change. Ice reﬂectance changes too, depending on its roughness, age, thickness, and the presence of air bubbles. Not-withstanding these difﬁculties, many snow and ice observation projects have been implemented based on passive remote sensing products.The fact that snow, ice and cloud are also likely to occur at the same time in a given loca-tion, meant that in the early days of RS assess-ments ice and snow were unusual, even after the inclusion of near-infrared channels on sensors. It was only once sensors in the middle-infrared were deployed that separation between these features became possible – because clouds have consider-ably higher reﬂectance than ice and snow in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Imagery from LandSat, Spot and Sentinel could be used for assessments of snow and ice, within the con-straints outlined above.An alternative approach uses passive microwave remote sensing and allows assessments of snow, area, depth, and/or snow water equivalent albeit at a coarse spatial resolution (from 12.5 km to 150 km). These are derived from a variety of satellites and sensors and are available for download as spa-tial time series at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions (see section below).A number of RS missions have focused primar-ily on monitoring the polar ice caps. Between 2003 and 2010, NASA’s ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) mission (using a satellite-based laser altimeter) collected multi-year elevation data which allowed the determination of ice sheet bal-ance, as well as topography and global vegetation data. A follow-up mission is underway with the Launch of ICESat-2 on 15 September 2018.The ESA initiated a similar mission in 1998, called CryoSat, but due to a problem during the launch in 2005, it failed to achieve orbit and was lost. Within 5 months, a replacement mission was approved and CryoSat-2 launched in 2010.  CryoSat-2 was the ﬁrst satellite to carry a syn-thetic aperture radar (SAR) on board. It provides data about the polar ice caps, and tracks changes in thickness with an accuracy of 1.3 cm. These datasets are proving critical in tracking the loss of polar ice in response to climate change.Identifying waterThe characteristic reﬂectance and absorbency characteristics of water allow its presence on the planet’s surface to be assessed easily using RS approaches."
4,"In the previous chapters, we have focused on pro-cesses above the earth’s surface. In this and the following chapter, we will consider water beneath the surface. Water occurs as soil water in the soil zone (also called the vadose zone or zone of aera-tion), and as groundwater below the water table (or phreatic surface) (the area below the water table is called the phreatic zone) (Figure 5.1). Although it might seem more logical to consider soil water ﬁrst, there are good reasons why it is easier to understand water below the water table. This relates to the fact that below the water table saturated conditions exist, in contrast to the unsatu-rated conditions in the soil zone. Water movement under unsaturated conditions is more complicated than at saturation, so we will deal with ground-water in this chapter and then build on that understanding in the following chapter, where we will discuss soil water. The study of water in the saturated zone is a specialised discipline under-taken by hydrogeologists o r  geohydrologists (these terms are usually used interchangeably, although a hydrogeologist would normally have a stronger grounding in geology and vice versa). This chapter is intended as a very brief introduction to ground-water, for further reading see Younger (2007) as an excellent introductory text and Hiscock and Bense (2014), Fitts (2013), Schwartz and Zhang (2003), and Todd and Mays (2005), for more advanced texts.LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of the importance of groundwater in the hydrological cycle. /H17039An understanding of the factors that determine (i) the direction and (ii) the rate of groundwater movement. /H17039An understanding of the key concepts in groundwater hydrology and the properties of aquifers. /H17039A knowledge of the techniques for measuring groundwater. /H17039An understanding of the importance of groundwater as a store and as a water supply.5GROUNDWATERGROUNDWATER87
can, of course, be ﬁlled with water or air. This can be less obvious to the naked eye in rock, but is nev-ertheless the case. The implication of this is that when thinking about materials below the earth we need to think in relation to three components (i) solids, (ii) pore spaces (voids or open spaces between particles) and then (iii) whether these are ﬁlled with air or water. The simple answer to the question above of ‘where is water stored?’, is of course, in these pore spaces or interstices. Under saturated con-ditions all the available spaces are ﬁlled by water, whereas in the vadose zone these might be ﬁlled by just air, or air and some water, and sometimes only water. It is important to note that although we WATER STORAGE BELOW THE EARTH’S SURFACESoil forms a relatively thin covering on the earth’s surface, typically less than 1–2 m deep, below which rock of various types is found. Often this occurs as a transition from soil, to weathered and fractured rock, and then to unweathered bedrock or rego-lith. So where is water stored below the surface? To understand this, we need to think about the nature of the materials forming soil and rock. Both soil and rock are composed of solid particles – if we lift a handful of soil we can clearly see this, but between these particles we can also see spaces. These spaces Figure 5.1 Water stored beneath the earth’s surface. Rainfall passes through the unsaturated vadose zone to become groundwater – this process is known as groundwater recharge. The broken line represents the water table, but this is almost always a transition from saturated to unsaturated conditions, rather than an abrupt change. The water table generally mirrors the topography of the land surface, although in a much more muted way. In certain types of geology this zone of transition (also called a capillary fringe – we’ll see why later), can be as deep as 1 m.Source: Adapted from Skinner et al. (2004)
88GROUNDWATERvoid ratio (usually symbolised as ε). Whereas poros-ity is the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume, the voids ratio is the volume of the voids (empty or full of water) to the volume of just the solids (Vs) (Equation 5.2). The reason for this dif-ference is related to the engineer’s greater interest in the structural properties of materials.ε=VVps (5.2)Another important difference between saturated and unsaturated conditions relates to pressure. Pore pressure arises from all the pores being full of water; this means that below the water table, pore water pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure. Above the water table, where pores contain a mix-ture of water and air, pore pressure is generally less than atmospheric pressure.In unconsolidated materials (e.g. soils or allu-vial ﬂoodplain deposits) the pore spaces are clearly evident, whereas they may be less obvious in hard rock. How rock was formed, and indeed what has happened to it subsequently, has an important bear-ing on porosity. Similarly, and also all things being equal, where the rock is in relation to others also has a bearing on porosity. For example, you might expect the same sandstone buried under layers of other rock to have less porosity, simply because the pressure above is likely to have compressed the par-ticles and pore spaces of the lower strata of rock.We can therefore distinguish between primary porosity and secondary porosity. Primary poros-ity is the porosity that exists at the time of for-mation of the rock. For example, alluvial sands in a ﬂood plain might have a high primary porosity. As they are buried, compressed and over geologi-cal time become consolidated into sandstone, they might lose some porosity and acquire secondary porosity. Other types of rock might be changed by the percolation of mineral rich water which precipi-tates out in the voids, reducing the available space and therefore porosity. As indicated above, geologi-cal processes, particularly metamorphic processes, refer to the soil zone as ‘unsaturated’, this does not mean that it is never saturated; saturation can, and does, occur. The name therefore refers to the gen-eral condition. As we shall see, it is also not quite as straightforward as this – for example, it is not just about visible spaces, but also the microscopic spaces, including those within the apparently solid structure of the individual particles. The signiﬁcant point to remember at this stage, however, is that the relationship between solid particles and spaces (or voids) is key in determining how much water can be stored in a soil or rock. If we are to understand groundwater, being able to quantify this relation-ship (and related processes) is obviously important. This is what we will try to do in the next section.PorosityA fundamental attribute of both soil and rock is its porosity. This is deﬁned simply as the proportion of a soil or rock that consists of open spaces, and must therefore logically be the volume of the pores divided by the total volume of the rock or soil, often represented using the symbol ‘n’. (Figure 5.2, Equation 5.1).nVVpt= (5.1)Where n is the porosity of a sample (dimensionless, or e.g. cm3/cm3), Vp is the volume of pores in the sample (e.g. cm3) and Vt is the total volume of the sample (e.g. cm3).Porosity is usually expressed as a decimal fraction (between 0 and 1), but it can also be expressed as a percentage. Table 5.1 gives an indication of the typical range in porosity of different types of rock and soil. What is evident from this table is that it is largely unconsolidated deposits and sedimentary rocks that have high porosities. Metamorphic and igneous rocks have lower porosities – unless fractur-ing and weathering has subsequently taken place.In civil engineering and soil mechanics, use is also made of a strongly related concept, that of the Figure 5.2 The concept of porosity, deﬁned as the proportion of the total volume of a body of soil or rock that is made up of pore spaces. As illustrated, various factors determine the porosity of a material.

these pockets are connected by smaller pathways of pores. In the ﬁrst case, although we would say that the rock was able to store water, it wouldn’t be much use to us as how would we get it out? In the second case the connected pore spaces would allow the ﬂow of water, so this would be a much more useful situation as we could extract the water. We can distinguish between these two situations by using the idea of total porosity, as distinct from effec-tive porosity. Whereas the former refers to the total number of voids, the latter refers only to the pro-portion of spaces that are connected. So total porosity says something about water storage in rock, effec-tive porosity tells us about how permeable the rock can signiﬁcantly change the characteristic of parent materials, rendering them harder and denser due to the pressures and temperatures they are subjected to. However, ‘hard’ igneous and metamorphic rocks are also subject to weathering, and in more geologi-cally active zones, fracturing and faulting. These processes break down rocks at various scales, gener-ating new materials with different porosities.Another qualiﬁer of our general understanding of porosity, is the important concept of effective porosity. The way to think about this is to imagine a rock where the water is included as completely separate little pockets – perhaps trapped there when the rock formed. Now think of a rock where Table 5.1 Typical values of porosity (n) for different types of rock and soilMaterialCommentPorosity (n) (%)UnconsolidatedSoilsPorosity is generally high in unconsolidated materials, depending on the degree of sorting and particle size distribution.

However, these are ‘relative’ and not ‘absolute’ deﬁnitions – whether a body of rock is an aquifer or not depends on what it is next to (Ward and Robinson 2000). For example, a mudstone layer between two layers of sandstone would be an aquitard with aquifers on either side. However, the same mudstone layer adjacent to an igneous body could be an aquifer, as it would con-tain considerably more water than the igneous rock.Types of aquifersThere are broadly two forms of aquifer type: uncon-ﬁned and conﬁned. An unconﬁned aquifer has no boundary above it and therefore the water table is free to rise and fall dependent on the amount of water contained in the aquifer (see Figure 5.3). The lower boundary of the aquifer may be imper-vious but it is the upper boundary, or water table, that is unconﬁned and may intersect the surface. A particular type of unconﬁned aquifer, is a perched water table or perched aquifer (see Figure 5.3) where an impermeable layer prevents the perco-lation of water down to the regional water table. Perched water tables may be temporary features reﬂecting variable hydraulic conductivities within the soil and rock, or they can be permanent features reﬂecting the overall geology. Quite often perched aquifers give rise to hillside seeps or small wetlands.A conﬁned aquifer has a ﬂow boundary (aquitard) above and below it that constricts the ﬂow of water into a conﬁned area (see Figure 5.3). Geological formations are the most common form of conﬁned aquifers, and as they often occur as layers, the ﬂow of water is restricted in the vertical dimension but not in the horizontal. Water within a conﬁned aqui-fer is normally under pressure and if intersected by a borehole will rise up higher than the constricted boundary. If the water reaches the earth’s surface it is referred to as an artesian well. A little later we will consider what might determine the height to which the water might rise. Related to this point, note the line marked ‘potentiometric surface’ in Figure 5.3 – we’ll come back to this later.is, or its ability to allow water to ﬂow through. Fractured rock, for example, has very high effec-tive porosity and can be an important pathway for groundwater ﬂow.These qualiﬁers of porosity are less relevant in the soil zone, but it is nevertheless important to note that porosity within a soil will vary depend-ing on geological parent material, location in the soil proﬁle and the history of soil forming processes at that location. We will focus on soils in the next chapter, so from here on we are focusing on the saturated zone only.WATER STORED AS GROUNDWATERWhat should be clear from the fundamental prin-ciples above is that how much water can be stored in rock or unconsolidated sediments depends very much on the type of rock. A body of rock or uncon-solidated sediment that can store water is called an aquifer. Historically this really meant storage and transmission in sufﬁcient quantities that could be abstracted for use, but nowadays extraction is not a requirement for it to be deﬁned as such. Aquifers range in geology from unconsolidated gravels such as the Ogallala aquifer in the USA (see Chapter 11) to distinct geological formations (e.g. chalk under-lying London and much of south-east England). As can be seen from Table 5.1, these are mostly sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated materials. In contrast, some rocks (e.g. unweathered igneous and metamorphic rocks) have very low porosities and do not store water. These strata (layers) or bodies of rock are called aquifuges (a relatively impermeable material that does not contain or transmit water) (Todd and Mays 2005). An aquiclude is a satu-rated, but relatively impermeable, material that does not yield much water. Saturated materials of intermediate water holding capacity or permeabil-ity (i.e. not as much as an aquifer, but more than an aquifuge and aquiclude) are known as aquita-rds, in other words they might retard the ﬂow of water but they might not exclude it. These terms are 92GROUNDWATER
by groundwater ﬂows. Features in the landscapes such as wetlands, ponds and lakes all represent areas where the local or regional water table has inter-sected the surface. Similarly, a river can be seen as a place where the outward ﬂow of subsurface water gives rise to surface ﬂow. This is referred to as a discharge zone (Figure 5.4). It stands to reason that subsurface (i.e. soil and groundwater ﬂows) must be contributing to streamﬂow or streams would dry up shortly after rain has fallen and ﬂowed away as sur-face runoff. In Chapter 7, we’ll explore this further, particularly from the perspective of what controls the relative proportions of soil and groundwater ﬂows in determining overall ﬂow in a river.It is traditional to think of groundwater sustain-ing streamﬂows during the summer months, which indeed it often does. However, the interaction Recharge, storage and dischargeAs mentioned in Chapter 1, recharge is the process whereby rainfall eventually ﬁnds its way through the vadose zone to the saturated phreatic zone to become groundwater. Once water has reached the water table it is generally not available for evapora-tion (except through transpiration by the deepest-rooted plants). The area over which this occurs is the recharge area for a particular groundwater resource (Figure 5.4), and identifying this, together with establishing the proportion of rainfall that becomes recharge, are important questions for groundwater resource managers to consider.Groundwater is not only important as a water resource contained in aquifers; flows in most streams are, to a greater or lesser degree, sustained 
Figure 5.3 Types of aquifers. In an unconﬁned aquifer the water level in the well is at the water table. In a conﬁned aquifer, the height of water in the well will depend on the amount of pressure within the conﬁned aquifer.Source: Federal Interagency Stream Restoration Working Group (FISRWG) (1998)GROUNDWATER93
between groundwater and streamﬂow is complex and depends very much on local circumstances. Water naturally moves towards areas where faster ﬂow is available and consequently can be drawn upwards towards a stream. This is the case in dry environments but is dependent on there being an unconﬁned aquifer near to the surface. If this is not the case then the stream may be contrib-uting water to the ground through inﬁltration. Figure 5.5 shows two different circumstances of interaction between the groundwater and stream. In Figure 5.5(a) the groundwater is contributing water to the streamﬂow as the water table is high. These are known as efﬂuent streams (or gaining streams). In Figure 5.5(b) the water table is low and the stream is contributing water to the ground-water. This is commonly the case where the main river source may be mountains a considerable dis-tance away and the river ﬂows over an alluvial plain with the regional groundwater table considerably deeper than stream level. These streams are known Figure 5.4 Groundwater ﬂow paths from a recharge zone to a discharge zone. Flow paths are of differ-ing length and ﬂow rates, which means that groundwater has a variable residence time in the ground.Source: Adapted from Skinner et al.

94GROUNDWATERFUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GROUNDWATER MOVEMENTTo make it easier to grasp the fundamentals, we will break this section into two components. Firstly, we will consider what determines the direc-tion of groundwater movement. Secondly, we will identify the factors which determine the rate at which this occurs (i.e. the speed of movement, or velocity vector if you already know the direction of movement). If one understands something about the rate of movement of groundwater, by implica-tion you also know something about the residence time of groundwater. Knowing ﬂow rates, recharge or replenishment rates and residence times are all important considerations in determining the sus-tainability of any aquifer for water supply. In the Middle East, for example, Saudi Arabia is able to draw on extensive ‘fossil water’ reserves – so called because they formed in an historic climate char-acterised by much higher rainfall. These aquifers have had long residence times, but would be char-acterised by low replenishment rates, and conse-quently are in a practical sense a ﬁnite rather than renewable resource. The case study below provides some insight into how we might determine the age of groundwater.as inﬂuent streams (or losing streams) and because of this process, may ﬂow only intermittently. The interaction between groundwater and streamﬂow is discussed further in Chapter 7, especially with respect to stormﬂows.In seasonal climates we might expect higher rainfalls in the wet season, and following recharge, more stored groundwater, reﬂected as a rise in the regional water table. In addition to being a zone of transition between saturated and unsaturated con-ditions, the water table is also typically seasonally dynamic and may vary more widely and over much longer time frames in relation to rainfall varia-tion and its climatic drivers. We might assume that more groundwater (i.e. a higher water table) might lead to more streamﬂow, but what is the relationship between these zones of recharge and zones of discharge? How quickly or slowly does groundwater move? We know for instance that similar droplets of water falling near to each other as rain might take very different pathways to reach a stream, one drop taking months or years and the other years or decades (see Figure 5.4). Why does deeper groundwater seem to travel so slowly? What controls the velocity and direction of movement of groundwater? We will consider these issues in the next section.Case studyMETHOD – AGEING GROUNDWATERAn important piece of information for somebody managing groundwater resources is the age of the water contained in the aquifer. This information will give an idea of how quickly any contaminated water may move towards an extraction zone, or how long ago the contamination occurred. Darcy’s Law gives an indication of the possible ﬂow rates within an aquifer, but the measurement is at too small a scale to be scaled up to estimate how long it has taken for water to reach a certain position. Frequently there is little idea of where the water has actually come from, so even if you could esti-mate water velocities you don’t know the distance travelled and therefore can’t estimate age. In order to overcome this problem, groundwater scientists use the chemistry of different substances dissolved within the water to estimate its age.Carbon dating is a common technique for the dating of terrestrial deposits but is problematic for young groundwater, since it is only accurate when the sample is more than 1,000 years old. Groundwater is frequently more than 1,000 years GROUNDWATER95old so it is possible to use the technique of car-bon dating, looking at the rate of decay of 14C in dissolved organic carbon. Another form of carbon dating looks for 14C resulting from the testing of thermo-nuclear weaponry.Another dating method, particularly for younger groundwater, is to look for concentrations of materials that we know have been added to the atmosphere by humans. Fortunately for ground-water dating, humans have been very good at pol-luting the atmosphere with substances that are then dissolved in precipitation. Figure 5.6 shows the concentration of four gases that have been added to the atmosphere in differing amounts. The relative concentrations of these gases in water samples give an estimate for the average age of the groundwater. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with 3 neutrons, was added to the atmosphere in large quantities through explosion of hydrogen bombs, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Tritium concentrations reached a peak in 1963 and have since declined to almost back-ground concentrations. Tritium has a radioactive half-life of 12.3 years. Chloroﬂuorocarbon (CFC) compounds were used in aerosols and refrigeration from the 1940s until their banning in the 1990s. CFC-11 concentration has slowly declined since about 1993, while CFC-12 concentration is still increasing, but at a much slower rate than before 1990. Sulphur hexaﬂuoride (SF6) is used for cool-ing and insulation, particularly in electronics.Another dating method is to look at the ratio of two isotopes of oxygen and/or two isotopes of hydrogen found in water molecules. When water in the atmosphere condenses to form rain there is a preferential concentration of heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecules. The heavy isotope of hydrogen is deuterium (1 neutron) and the heavy isotope of oxygen is 18O. The colder the temperature is at time of condensation the more enriched with deuterium and 18O the water sample will be. In climates with distinct seasons the amount of deuterium and 18O in rainfall samples will vary according to seasons. By taking a series of water samples from rainfall and groundwater, a comparison can be made between the time series. If the ground-water shows considerable variation in deuterium and/or 18O concentrations, then it is relatively recent rainfall. If there is very little variation then it is assumed that the groundwater is a mix-ture of rainfall from both summers and winters in the past and is therefore older. This is demon-strated in Figure 5.7. The technique of looking at oxygen and hydrogen isotopes is particularly common as a way of determining whether water in a stream is new (i.e. recently derived from rainfall) or old (has been resident in groundwa-ter for some time).By measuring the concentrations of contami-nants like tritium or the ratio of isotopes of oxy-gen, an estimate of the age of groundwater can be made. The different ways in which water moves through the unsaturated and saturated zones of catchments means that groundwater and stream-ﬂows contain water with different residence times. The water in a sample does not have a discrete age, but has a distribution of ages. This distribu-tion is described by a conceptual ﬂow or mixing Figure 5.6 Tritium concentrations in rainfall, CFC and SF6 concentrations in the atmosphere 1940–2002. Tritium units (TU) are 1 tritium atom in 1,018 hydrogen atoms. CFC and SF6 are in parts per trillion by volume (pptv).Source: Figure redrawn from Stewart et al. (2007)

is capable of generating 14 GW; providing three quarters of the electricity consumption of Paraguay and 17 per cent of Brazil’s. In this case mechani-cal energy is converted into electrical energy. The reason for this remarkable power output is related both to the naturally high ﬂow rate in the Parana River, but importantly also due to the very large difference in height between the turbine inlets and outlets (118 m). This difference in height means gravity is working in your favour, and is known as elevation head.In the case of groundwater, it is very important to recognise that while elevation head is important, it is not the only factor that is relevant, as Fig-ure 5.8 appears to be suggesting that groundwater can also move upwards against gravity (look at the lower ﬂow paths). To help understand this, take a look at Figure 5.8. In the top ﬁgure, if the tap is opened, water will clearly ﬂow down from the tank and out through the tap. This is because of the action of gravity and the elevation head that exists. Now consider the lower ﬁgure. Here a bend is present in the pipe, which means that in order to escape, water needs to ﬂow upwards against gravity. What determines the direction of groundwater movement?In the introduction to this chapter, we established that in most cases of simple underlying geology, the water table follows the topography, although in a more muted way. This means that at some loca-tions (e.g. below a hill), the water table would be ‘higher’ than the water table in the valley below. Because of the effects of gravity, we would expect the groundwater at higher elevation to move down-wards towards the valley bottom. This of course is true; it is after all the reason why rivers ﬂow down-stream from source to sea, and groundwater will also ﬂow ‘downwards’. We can express the potential for the river to ﬂow downstream by looking at the differences in elevation. Water held at elevation has mechanical energy and therefore the power to do work. For example, the Itaipu Dam on the Brazil/Paraguay border is the world’s biggest hydroelec-tric power scheme. The concrete dam has a height of 196 m (equivalent to a 65-storey building), hold-ing back the waters of the mighty Parana River. From near the top of the wall, water is led into 20 turbines and the combined power of this water model, which reﬂects the average conditions in the catchment (Stewart et al. 2007). Maloszewski and Zuber (1982) provide an extensive review of these mixing models; in short they account for the size of groundwater reservoir, the concentration of contaminant and the likely time of residence within a well-mixed groundwater reservoir.Using the techniques outlined here, the average age of groundwater or streamwater can be derived. Studies of groundwater age frequently use a com-bination of the different techniques to derive an average residence time of water in a catchment, or the groundwater age. It is important to realise that it is an average residence time, not absolute. The water contained in the groundwater reservoir will be a mixture of water that has inﬁltrated rap-idly and some that moved very slowly through the unsaturated zone.
Figure 5.7 Changing ratios of isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen with time in a seasonal climate. Rainfall is heavily inﬂuenced by temperature and shows large variation between seasons. The older the groundwater the more dampened down the time series.GROUNDWATER97fact that it is at pressure means it has the ability to move, independent of elevation, in other words it has a pressure head too. In some cases, the pres-sure head means that groundwater can ﬂow uphill (rather than just downwards because of the eleva-tion difference). It follows that if we are to under-stand the ability of groundwater to move, we need to consider both the pressure head and the elevation head. Importantly, it is the combination of these two heads, or the hydraulic or total head, that is critical in determining the direction of groundwa-ter movement.Figure 5.9 illustrates this a little more clearly, showing that groundwater ﬂows from high total head to low total head, rather than just from points of high pressure to low pressure, or high elevation to low elevation. Spend a few minutes looking at these ﬁgures and the accompanying explanation.The concept of a ﬂuid having mechanical energy was formalised in 1738 by Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782). Bernoulli’s law is a fundamental equation of ﬂuid mechanics, and recognises ﬁrstly that that objects have three types of mechanical energy; kinetic, potential and pressure, and secondly that the sum of these remains constant (the idea of 
We know from experience that if we did open the tap in the lower ﬁgure, water would certainly still ﬂow out, despite having to ﬂow ‘uphill’. This sug-gests that it is not elevation head alone that inﬂu-ences groundwater movement.We have already established that groundwater can be at pressure (see earlier reference to artesian wells, and also the concept of pore pressure). The

(b) Hosepipe with a loop in which the water must always ﬂow upwards to reach the tap. The laminar nature of most groundwater ﬂow means that it tends to behave more as if it was in a stack of pipes like this, rather than like water ﬂowing down a stream channel.Source: Reproduced from Younger (2007), with permission

If you re-arrange the terms of the equation, solving for h, rather than p, what do you get? Clearly, this is equivalent to the second term in Equation 5.4. In other words, the pressure head term in Bernoulli’s equation is really just the height of the water column. So it is the height of this water column and its elevation above a datum that deter-mines the total head (Figure 5.10).Although it is important to realise that total head is the combination of pressure head and elevation head, in practice we do not have to calculate them separately. Total head is relatively easy to measure in the ﬁeld (Younger 2007). We’ll discuss measure-ment techniques a little later in this chapter, so for now let’s just assume that we have either measured the depth to the water table in Figure 5.10, or alter-natively have used a pressure transducer to measure the pressure, P, at the point noted in the well and calculated the height of the column using the re-arranged hydrostatic equation.The value of doing this is that once the total head can be calculated at two or more points, the conservation of energy). Pioneering work by Hubbert (1940) in applying these concepts to groundwater laid important foundations for the study of ground-water movement. He recognised that groundwa-ter ﬂow occurred due to spatial variation in the ‘mechanical energy content per mass of water’, and coined the term ‘potential’ to represent this. This is the origin of the term potentiometric surface shown in Figure 5.2 – the potentiometric surface is an imaginary line showing the height to which water would rise if wells intercepted a conﬁned aquifer. His modiﬁcation of Bernoulli’s equation shows that the hydraulic head (or total mechanical energy available) is the sum of three components – the ﬁrst term is the elevation head, the second term is the pressure head and the ﬁnal term the velocity head (Equation 5.3).hzPgvgw=++ρ22 (5.3)Where h is the hydraulic or total head (mechani-cal energy available), z is the elevation head, P is the pressure exerted by the water column, ρw is the ﬂuid density, v is the velocity and g is gravitational acceleration.The last term in the equation above represents the kinetic energy component, or the energy asso-ciated with movement. Because it is very small in groundwater it is ignored, but as we will see in a later chapter, is very important in river ﬂow. So in groundwater, total head can be expressed as Equa-tion 5.4:hzPgw=+ρ (5.4)Those of you that have recently done a school  science module might recognise something familiar about the second term, the pressure head. How do you calculate the pressure under a column of water? This is known as the hydrostatic pressure and is given by Equation 5.5:
Figure 5.10 Relationships between total or hydraulic head, pressure head and elevation head.GROUNDWATER99direction of this slope (high total head to low total head), the rate at which this occurs is proportional to the hydraulic gradient between these points (Figure 5.11). All other things being equal, the higher this slope, the greater the ﬂow. The con-cept of hydraulic gradient thus includes the ideas of elevation and pressure head discussed earlier. In an unconﬁned aquifer it can be assumed that the hydraulic gradient is equal to the drop in height of water table over a horizontal distance (i.e. the elevation head). In a conﬁned aquifer it is the drop in phreatic surface (i.e. the level that water in bore-holes reaches given the pressure the water is under) over a horizontal distance.As you will recall from your earlier science education, to change a relationship from one of proportionality to an equation, a coefﬁcient of proportionality is required. Darcy’s work found that this coefﬁcient of proportionality was strongly related to the grain size of the sand, in other words, largely a property of the medium through which the water is moving. This fac-tor is now known as the hydraulic conductiv-ity, sometimes also referred to as the coefﬁcient of permeability. There are many different ways of formulating Darcy’s law, but the two most direction of groundwater ﬂow can be determined. This is straightforward, as groundwater always moves from a high total head to a low total head.What determines the rate of groundwater movement?We will now turn to considering the factors that determine the speed of groundwater movement. The pioneering work in this respect was under-taken by a nineteenth-century French engineer, Henry Darcy. Darcy was concerned with the water supply for Dijon, and in particular how impurities from aquifer-fed spring water could be removed by sand ﬁltration (Darcy 1856). Darcy designed a series of observations on the characteristics of ﬂow through sand, observing that the ‘rate of ﬂow of water through a porous medium was propor-tional to the hydraulic gradient’ (Darcy 1856). The hydraulic gradient being the difference in elevation between two points, divided by the dis-tance between them. In other words, and applied in a groundwater context, the slope of the lines of hydraulic head. Linking back to the previous section, while the direction of groundwater ﬂow between two or more points is determined by the 
Figure 5.11 The concept of hydraulic gradient.100GROUNDWATERPROPERTIES OF AQUIFERSHydraulic conductivityWe’ve seen from the earlier section that establishing the direction of groundwater ﬂow and the hydraulic gradient can be relatively straightforward – all that is required is observations from two or more bore-holes. However, calculating corresponding velocities or discharges is much more challenging because this requires you to know the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat in Equations 5.6 and 5.7), and is a fundamentally important parameter in groundwater studies. Broadly speaking, this is the ability of a porous medium to transmit water, and is a consequence of both the size of pores within the soil or rock and the interconnectivity between these pores. Clearly, it is related to the idea of effective porosity mentioned earlier. While effective porosity is simply the ratio of connected pores to the total volume of material (dimensionless), the satu-rated hydraulic conductivity is a measure of the rate at which water can ﬂow through this material and has units in distance per unit time (e.g. m/s, or more typi-cally m/day because of the slow rate of movement).Table 5.2 gives typical values of saturated hydrau-lic conductivity for a range of material types. Note the wide variation in these values; in fact, hydrau-lic conductivity is known to vary over 13 orders of magnitude. As we shall shortly see, hydraulic conductivities also vary spatially at both micro and macro scales, representing a further challenge for groundwater scientists.Although in the above discussion, hydraulic con-ductivity is considered a property of the material, this is not entirely true. It is also a property of the ﬂuid passing through – particularly its density and viscosity. But if we assume that we are considering just freshwater, then this is not a problem. How-ever, if we are concerned with saline groundwater, which has different density and other properties, we would need to make further adjustments.A further complicating factor is that hydraulic conductivity may well vary depending on which direction it is measured in (e.g. horizontally or ver-tically). This is not surprising since the structure common and easily understood forms are shown in Equations 5.6 and 5.7.vKhhLsat=⋅−()⎡⎣⎢⎢⎤⎦⎥⎥12 (5.6)Where v is the velocity of groundwater flow (m/s), Ksat i s  t h e  s a t u r a t e d  h y d r a u l i c  c o n d u c-tivity (m/s i.e. the same units as v), h1 and h2 are the heights of the water table (m) at two locations and L is the distance between them (m). The term in square brackets is the hydrau-lic gradient. Groundwater hydrologists are not only interested in the rate of flow, but also the groundwater discharge – or the volumes of flow over a given time period. This is obviously important because usually we want to be able to extract volumes of groundwater. In this case we need to think about the ‘area’ over which this flow is occurring. Think about this as the cross- sectional thickness of the aquifer, at right angles to the direction of flow. In this case, Dar-cy’s equation can be written as:QAKhhLsat=⋅⋅−()⎡⎣⎢⎢⎤⎦⎥⎥12 (5.7)Where Q is the groundwater discharge (m3/s), A is the cross-sectional area (m2) through which the ﬂow occurs, and the remainder is the same as Equation 5.6.Darcy’s law is an empirical law (i.e. based on experimental observation) that appears to hold under many different situations and spatial scales. It underlies most of groundwater hydrology and is very important for the management of ground-water resources. Groundwater models such as the US Geological Survey’s (USGS’s) MODFLOW 6 (Langevin et al. 2017), essentially solve Dar-cy’s equation in three dimensions, so saturated hydraulic conductivity needs to be known in the vertical direction (z), as well as over the horizon-tal planes (x,y).GROUNDWATER101
region of interest can be applied in Darcy’s equation to establish groundwater ﬂow rates.Speciﬁc yield and speciﬁc retentionEarlier in this chapter we introduced the concept of porosity, or the proportion of a rock that is com-prised of pores. We clariﬁed this by also referring to the idea of effective porosity, where it is only the con-nected pores that are relevant. We need to modify our understanding further by considering whether all the water stored in connected pores would be available for abstraction. The answer to this question is that it is not, and the reason for this relates to capillary forces. Capillary action occurs when water interacts with a solid material. You will be familiar with the idea of the level of a soft drink inside a straw rising above the of the rock (e.g. bedding planes, orientation of particles) is likely to be different. A completely uniform material would be homogeneous (Ksat is the same everywhere in the aquifer) and isotropic (Ksat is the same in all directions through the aquifer). In reality, many aquifers are the opposite, being both heterogeneous (Ksat varies spatially through the aqui-fer) and anisotropic (Ksat varies in different directions such as parallel vs perpendicular to the bedding).Although Ksat can be measured from a small sample in the laboratory (Klute and Dirksen 1986), in the management of water resources it is more common from larger-scale well-pumping tests (see Freeze and Cherry (1979) for more details). The well-pumping test gives a spatially averaged Ksat value at the scale of interest to those concerned with water resources, and once established for a particular Table 5.2 Typical values of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) for different types of materialK(m/day)Unconsolidated deposits(principally of Quaternary age)Indurated rocks with moderate jointingRocks containing caves and smaller open voidsPlutonic and metamorphic rocksSandGravelDiamictShalesSandstonesCarbonatesMost tuffs and lavasKarstBasalt lavas10610510410310210 110–110–210–310–410–510–610–710–8Source: Reproduced from Younger (2007)102GROUNDWATERby these capillary forces. The width of this zone will depend on the grain size and will be much lower for say, gravels than ﬁne grained mud deposits.The second practical implication relates to the question we posed at the start of this section – is all water that might be contained within interconnected pores of rock available to us? We said earlier that it wasn’t because of capillary forces. These forces act to hold water back and can be stronger than gravity – this means that water will not ﬂow to the point where we might abstract it from. This gives rise to two inter-related properties of an aquifer, speciﬁc yield (normally symbolized as Sy) and speciﬁc retention. Speciﬁc retention is the water that is held back in the aquifer because of capillary forces. Conversely, speciﬁc yield is the water that can be extracted from the aqui-fer. It follows logically that the sum the speciﬁc retention and the speciﬁc yield must equal the effective porosity. Younger’s (2007) representation of this is very helpful in drawing out these distinctions (Figure 5.12).The relationship between the concepts of poros-ity, speciﬁc yield and speciﬁc retention, for uncon-solidated deposits can be seen in Figure 5.13. As the particle size increases, both the porosity and the speciﬁc retention decrease. Although clay has the highest porosity, the strength of capillary forces is highest and so has a low speciﬁc yield. In this exam-ple, sand has the highest speciﬁc yield and therefore would be the most useful aquifer.StorativityThe concept of speciﬁc yield and speciﬁc retention relate only to unconﬁned aquifers, where the water table can move under the inﬂuence of gravity and in response to say, pumping. In a conﬁned aquifer the pores do not ‘drain’ under the inﬂuence of gravity and the factors controlling storage behaviour are very different (see Younger (2007) for a more com-plete description of these). The term storativity, (usually symbolised as S), is used in this case. This is deﬁned as ‘the amount of water which can be removed from a unit volume of conﬁned aquifer per unit decline in water level (measured in wells penetrating that aquifer)’ (Younger 2007: 17).level of the drink in the container when the straw is placed in the liquid. The liquid is sucked up the straw and if you looked closely you would also see adhesion on the edges – where the liquid level curves upwards around the straw (a concave meniscus). If you placed straws of various diameters in the drink you would also see a difference; the smaller the diameter of the straw the higher the level the liquid in the straw would reach. Capillary action is a suction (i.e. a force) that acts against gravity and is a characteristic of the physics of small spaces. It is primarily a consequence of the surface tension property of water. In the natu-ral environment, droplets of water form because of the relatively high surface tension of water, arising from the cohesive properties of water. Cohesion means that liquid molecules have greater attraction to one another as opposed to the air molecules (refer back to the dipolar nature of water discussed in Chapter 1). But when in contact with some surfaces, water molecules have a stronger attraction to the molecules of the surface than each other (or the air) – this is adhesion. For example, on mineral surfaces water tends to spread, wetting the surface. In our other example, the liquid in the straw is more attracted to the sur-face of the straw and this is why there is a concave meniscus in the straw. In small spaces such as soil and rock pores, surface tension (caused by cohesion within the liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid particles act together to move water against gravity. Importantly these forces also act to hold water against gravity. As was the case with the straws of differing diameter, these forces are more pronounced the smaller the spaces. Since there is a relationship between the size of grains and the pores that are formed between them, this means that there is a general relationship between grain size and cap-illarity or the strength of this suction; the ﬁner the grain size the stronger this force.Now let’s consider what the practical implica-tions of capillary forces are for groundwater. Firstly, you will remember from Figure 5.1 that we referred to the capillary fringe in the vicinity of the water table. Now you will be able to better understand that this occurs because water is drawn upwards from the saturated zone into the unsaturated zone Figure 5.12 A conceptual sketch to explain the storage properties of unconﬁned aquifers.Source: Reproduced from Younger (2007), with permission

SpecificretentionSpecificyield104GROUNDWATERscreen can also be surrounded by a gravel pack which acts as a ﬁlter, particularly if the well is for water supply. Wells are commonly used for water extrac-tion and monitoring the water table in unconﬁned aquifers. Where the purpose is monitoring, water depth can be estimated by use of a dipper (Younger 2007). This is a measuring tape which contains a pair of electrodes. The tape is lowered into the borehole and when the electrodes comes into contact with the water, an electrical circuit is completed and a sound alarm and/or bulb is illuminated. This allows the depth to the water table to be read off the tape. The hydraulic head can then be established by subtract-ing this depth from the surveyed ground elevation at the top of the well. Where frequent or continu-ous measurements are required a pressure transducer, attached to a data logger can be installed. This can be set to take measurements at speciﬁc times, or alter-natively when user-selected thresholds of change in head are detected (Younger 2007). Alternatively, head can be estimated and logged by use of a pressure transducer. This is a submergible sensor normally placed below the lowest anticipated groundwa-ter level, and works on the basis of measurements of deﬂection of a membrane exposed to pore water pressure on the one side and atmospheric pressure on the other (Fitts 2013). The depth that the pressure transducer is installed at needs to be known (refer back to Figure 5.9) in order for the hydraulic head to be calculated using Equation 5.4.A piezometer is a special type of well that is designed to measure the hydraulic head at a particular loca-tion and depth. The principle of construction is the same, except that the tube is narrower (usually <30 cm), and the area of perforation of the tube is only in the vicinity of its base. Usually the borehole is also ﬁlled with a material such as bentonite to prevent water from the surface of or anywhere else along the borehole seeping in. This means that the height to which the water rises in the tube (or piezometer) is thus a record of the mechanical energy exerted by the groundwater at the base of the tubing. Alterna-tively, as in the case of wells, a pressure transducer can be used. Piezometers are therefore used to mea-sure the total head at different depths in the aqui-fer, sometimes as ‘nests’ within the same borehole TransmissivityTransmissivity extends the idea of hydraulic conduc-tivity by considering the thickness over which this process is occurring. In a way, it is an indication of how useful the aquifer might be from a groundwater resource perspective. For example, a thin layer of sedi-ment might have a very high hydraulic conductivity but as it is a thin layer this might not yield much water. In contrast a much thicker layer – which might have a much lower saturated hydraulic conductivity –  could yield much more water, just because it is thicker. Transmissivity is estimated by Equation 5.8.TKbsat=⋅ (5.8)Where T is transmissivity (typically m2/day), and Ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity (m/day) and b is the saturated thickness of the aquifer (m). Note though, that b can vary over time, so this is a dynamic rather than static property of an aquifer. This formulation also assumes that Ksat does not vary signiﬁcantly over the aquifer thickness. The many different terms used in groundwater hydrology at ﬁrst appear confusing, but it is important to under-stand them as they all refer to speciﬁc properties of the way water moves, or doesn’t move, underground.MEASURING AND ESTIMATING GROUNDWATERWells and piezometersThe main measurement techniques for water in the saturated zone are through wells and piezometers. The term borehole is often used to denote a well that has been drilled for the purpose of extracting water. Both wells and piezometers measure the height of the water table but in slightly different ways. A well is drilled into the ground using specialised equip-ment, and usually a tube surrounded by some form of casing is inserted. The latter could be slotted steel or plastic and is sometimes called a well screen. This casing prevents the sides of the well closing in, but importantly is permeable. This allows water to per-colate through from all parts of the column. The well GROUNDWATER105Once one, or multiple piezometers or wells are installed, a variety of piezometer and pumping tests can be used to help determine the characteristics of the aquifer under investigation. Review of these is beyond the scope of this chapter, but most standard groundwater texts will explain these.Surprisingly, groundwater (along with other ter-restrial storage) can also be estimated from space by satellites. Becker (2006) gives a useful over-view of the potential for satellite remote sensing of groundwater. Some approaches are only applicable at the scale of the very large basin, but nevertheless form a useful addition to the range of techniques for tracking total terrestrial storage over time. The case study below provides a little more information on this approach.to see variation with depth or alternatively across an aquifer to establish spatial variation. With sufﬁcient point observations, and via interpolation between these points of known pressure head, lines of equi-potential can be drawn. Think of these lines (usually represented by the symbol Φ), as lines of equal head, much like contours represent topography, or isohy-ets represent lines of equal rainfall (see Chapter 2). The interpolated 2-D surface is the potentiometric surface (see Figure 5.2), also called the piezometric surface. Once this surface is known, spatial patterns of groundwater ﬂow can be established, as ground-water ﬂow will occur in streamlines in a direction perpendicular to the lines of equipotential, just in the same way as ﬂow on the land surface occurs perpen-dicular to contour lines.Case studyMEASURING WATER STORAGE FROM SPACEThrough remote sensing technologies it is possible to monitor change in Earth’s water storage. The Gravity Recovery & Climate Experiment (GRACE) was a revolutionary satellite mission launched in 2002. Operated jointly by NASA and the Ger-man Aerospace Center, the mission originally had a lifespan of 5 years. However due to its major suc-cess, the mission was extended until 2017 (with the satellites falling out of orbit in early 2018).The GRACE mission consisted of two satellites in tandem orbit (≈500 km above the Earth’s surface). The on-board instruments constantly measured the distance between the two satellites which ﬂuctuated around 200 km as a result of Earth’s changing gravi-tational ﬁeld. This idea of the two satellites ‘chasing’ one another gave the pair their nicknames of ‘Tom and Jerry’ amongst ground teams. The distance mea-surements were reported with 1 µm accuracy. As the instruments were passive sensors, data produced was not limited in terms of cloud cover or solar illumina-tion, unlike many optical satellite instruments.Monthly measurements from the satellites were used to produce mathematical representations of the Earth’s gravity ﬁeld, with a spatial resolution of 380 km. The main drivers of such changes are shifting oceanic and atmospheric circulations and the redistribution of water within the hydrologi-cal cycle (e.g. changing ice sheet mass). However, the monthly temporal resolution of GRACE data-sets has been noted as a limitation of the mission, especially when compared to traditional hydro-logical datasets.Forming the monthly datasets are ≈7,500 indi-vidual gravity proﬁles (≈250/day). These proﬁles can be directly related to water storage. GRACE ground teams used the gravitational proﬁle to quantify monthly anomalies in the Terrestrial Water Stor-age (TWS) to an accuracy of 1.5 cm. TWS repre-sents water stored at all levels – groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, ice, and vegetation biomass. The GRACE mission provided the only sat-ellites able to monitor water storage below the ﬁrst few centimetres of the surface. However, GRACE TWS data has no vertical resolution and therefore users cannot easily distinguish between water stored in the different vertical elements of the system."
5,"WATER IN THE UNSATURATED ZONEIn the previous chapter we considered water below the water table in the saturated zone. For reasons which will become evident later in the chapter, the behaviour of water in the unsatu-rated zone is a little more complicated. The unsaturated zone is also variously referred to as the zone of aeration, or the vadose zone. We should also point out at this stage that by refer-ring to it as the unsaturated zone, this does not mean that it is never saturated, only that its typi-cal condition is one of being less than saturated. Water in the unsaturated zone is called soil water or pore water.Since the majority of water in the unsaturated zone is held in the soil, we begin this chapter by develop-ing an understanding of the composition and struc-ture of soil, including the fundamental forces that determine the behaviour of water in the vadose zone. We then move on to developing an understanding of how some of the hydrological properties of a soil can be represented by parameters, and how from these we can characterise how soil redistributes water.CHARACTERISTICS OF SOILSSoil is essentially a continuum of solid particles, air and water. A completely dry soil consists of solid particles with air in the spaces between the 6SOIL WATER
LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of the fundamental forces inﬂuencing the behaviour of water in the soil. /H17039A knowledge of how the properties of soil inﬂuence water retention characteristics. /H17039An understanding of the principles of water movement in the soil and how the soil absorbs, retains and releases water, thereby regulating runoff. /H17039A knowledge of the techniques used to measure inﬁltration. /H17039A knowledge of the techniques used to measure and estimate the amount of water stored as soil moisture.108SOIL WATEROne of the most critical factors determining the behaviour of water in a soil is the grain size of the soil particles. Since soil is seldom made up of a uni-form size of particle, it is more correctly the grain size distribution of the particles. In other words, what proportion of the soil is made up of particles of dif-ferent sizes. Unfortunately, there is not a standard system for classifying the size of particles, agrono-mists, for example, have one approach while soil scientists and geotechnical engineers have another (Figure 6.1). The reason for this is that they each focus on a slightly different property of a soil, and for different purposes. Where they differ is in rela-tion to the slightly larger particles; most systems agree that any particle below 0.002 mm (2 µm) is a clay. Clays – and there are many different types – are minerals in their own right and are formed as products of the weathering process. For example, the mineral feldspar, which is a common mineral found in rocks such as granite, weathers into clays. Particles above 2 to 6 µm are considered sands, and these might be comprised of small fragments of minerals such as feldspar and quartz. The coarse sand fraction is large enough to be seen and felt when rubbed between the ﬁngers and thumb, it has texture. Intermediate between a clay and a sand particle is silt. Individual particles of silt and clay can’t be felt but clays tend to make the soil feel sticky, whereas silt particles impart a silky and sometimes slightly sticky feel (White 2006). We use the term soil texture, to refer to the grain size properties of a soil, and in a way it is short hand for ‘grain size distribution’.Earlier we said it is the grain size distribution which has an important bearing on the hydrologi-cal behaviour of the soil, in other words, the rela-tive proportion of sand, silt and clay in a soil exerts a very strong inﬂuence on the ability of a soil to absorb, retain and release moisture. In fact, the rela-tive proportions of these not only determine the hydrological behaviour of a mineral soil but also its textural classiﬁcation, often used as the ‘name’ or ﬁrst description of the soil by those who are not soil scientists. Figure 6.2 shows examples of triangular diagrams which classify a soil into one of several particles (the voids), and no water. In contrast, a soil is saturated when all the voids are ﬁlled with water and there is no air, as it has been displaced. The movement of water in a soil therefore depends on the processes of ﬁlling and emptying the pore spaces and the various forces that come into effect at this micro-scale. Before we discuss these, we will consider the particle component of soils and how these determine the overall hydrological charac-teristics of a soil. We also need to consider how soils are formed and evolve as this determines how they change across the landscape, which in turn determines in part how hydrological processes vary across the landscape.Soil composition and textureSome soils (mineral soils) are comprised almost completely of just mineral particles – the tiny fragments of rock they were formed from. Simi-larly, these parent rocks are formed from a range of minerals (e.g. quartz, feldspar) each in turn having their own characteristics such as shape, hardness and weathering properties. Clearly the underlying geology will therefore be a key determinant of the type of soil present in an area. However, we also need to remember that soils are formed through deposition, so may also reﬂect the upstream geol-ogy as rocks and minerals weather, erode and are transported downstream. Other soils, especially those which develop in heavily vegetated areas, have a high component of organic matter (e.g. 12–18 per cent), and these are known as organic soils. In reality this is a continuum and most soils will have some organic matter (typically between 1 and 6 per cent) in the upper layer. This occurs because of the breakdown of vegetation and will be higher where there is a deeper litter layer (e.g. forests). The presence of organic matter in a soil is important for a range of biological processes (e.g. it is an important source of energy for bacteria involved in denitriﬁcation), and it also inﬂuences some hydrological processes we will discuss later (e.g. inﬁltration). From here on, we will focus on mineral soils.ClaySiltFine sandCoarse sandGravel(a) International or AtterbergSystem0.0020.020.22.0ClaySiltFine sandMedium sandCoarse sandVery coarse sandGravel(b) USDA System0.0022.01.00.50.05 0.1ClaySiltFine sandMedium sandCoarse sandStones(c) Soil survey of England and Wales, British Standards and Mass.

Figure 6.2 (Continued)SOIL WATER111Below this are the ‘A’ and ‘B’ horizons which may grade into ‘C’ (the regolith or consolidated rock). Figure 6.3 contains a clue as to why these layers are present anyway. Note the annotations which state ‘zone of eluviation’ and ‘zone of illuviation’. Eluviation is the process whereby salts and other materials are leached out of the proﬁle, while the zone of illuviation is where these are deposited or precipitated out.These processes are directly related to the movement of water in the soil. The downwards  movement of rainfall dissolves, mobilises and transports compounds in solution, which are then deposited lower down, thereby differentiating the soil horizons. Fluctuating moisture levels also impact upon the availability of air. When a soil is saturated, there is no air and therefore no oxygen. This means that the chemical environment turns from an oxidising to a reducing one, again chang-ing the nature of the chemical processes occurring. Over time, these horizons develop as a result of the combination of the effects of ﬂuctuating water (and oxygen) levels, but also as a result of other processes including those resulting from micro-bial and animal action.The nature of soil layers is important to under-stand in hydrology because it inﬂuences that rate at which water passes through, or is stored within, the soil. For example, we know that soils with a high organic content in their upper layers are able to store more water than those with low organic content.Now let us consider horizontal heterogeneity; how a soil varies spatially across the landscape. Even for soils with the same parent material, soil scientists have observed that the character of a soil varies markedly moving from the top of a hill downslope to the river valley bottom (Figure 6.4). This is known as a catena. At the top of the hill, soils might be well drained and reddish in colour. The reddish colour denotes oxidising conditions suggesting that the soil is typically aerated, which implies that it is well-drained. Conversely, soils towards the bottom of the valley might show blue/grey horizons indicating the reducing conditions different classes depending on the relative propor-tion of sand, silt and clay. These vary by location (for example, the United Kingdom: Figure 6.2(a), and Australia: Figure 6.2(b)), but the principle is the same. The textural class of the soil is established by starting from a point on each axis that corre-sponds to the proportion represented by that grain size and then extending that line to the point where they intersect.Vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in soilEarlier we noted that the underlying geology is a key factor in determining the type of soil pres-ent at a location. We also mentioned that we should remember that soil arises from deposition of particles transported from further upstream in a catchment (by wind, water or ice) and over long time-scales. However, parent material is just one important factor, and there are several others at play in the process of soil formation (pedogenesis). These include topography, climate (especially rain-fall and temperature), the action of organisms, and of course, time.Let us now turn to considering vertical hetero-geneity in soils. This means how different a soil is as you go down a proﬁle. If you think back to when you may have seen a soil proﬁle exposed, quite often you would have noticed distinct layering. Some-times a darker, richer layer occurs at the top, with one or more layers of slightly different colour or form below that. Soil scientists call these horizons, each of which develops its own character (and there-fore hydrological properties) over time. Soil scien-tists rely on the presence and characteristics of these horizons to classify and name soils beyond a simple textural class. Figure 6.3 shows the broad categories of horizons. The left ﬁgure shows vertical hetero-geneity as a soil scientist might see it, whereas the right ﬁgure is a simpliﬁed conceptualisation and how the soil might be represented in a hydrologi-cal model. Where there is a deep litter layer, there is a high level of organic matter, sometimes suf-ﬁcient to warrant its own horizon or ‘O’ horizon.

Figure 6.4 shows a catena in cross section, but when you imagine what soils mapped on this basis might look like in plan, you would expect group-ings on the tops of hills and in river valleys, with which arise when the soil is waterlogged. Soils with intermediate levels of waterlogging are often darker with mottling and sometimes rusty coloured patches.114SOIL WATER
can these processes give rise to soil horizons which are visibly different, they can also give rise to a dis-tinct soil structure. By soil structure, we mean the orientation of soil particles or their grouping into larger formations, some of which have signiﬁcant implications for the movement of moisture.Movement of water in soils can occur in two domains. The ﬁrst is the macropore domain – this refers to ﬂow in cracks, cavities, animal burrows, old vegetation root pathways and the like (Fig-ure 6.6). These structures are largely secondary and distinct from the fundamental structure of the soil. Flow can be quick in these structures and will tend to erode and extend these networks as it tries to ﬁnd the easiest ﬂow path. These pathways can also be fairly large – soil pipes are a good example of intermediate differentiation down slopes. Super-imposing on this variation in topography a varia-tion in underlying geology and climate, it is not difﬁcult to appreciate why a soils map is highly heterogeneous (Figure 6.5). Given the importance of soils in regulating catchment response, obtaining a sufﬁciently representative understanding of the variation and characteristics of soils across a catch-ment is therefore of importance to any hydrological analysis of a catchment.Soil structureEarlier we introduced the idea of vertical heteroge-neity in soils, indicating that various physical and chemical processes occur continuously. Not only 
Figure 6.5 A section of a soils map for the United Kingdom illustrating the high spatial heterogeneity of soils (Soils data: Cranﬁeld University, National Soil Resources Institute).116SOIL WATERin a later section), we are emphasising the matrix domain and ignoring the macropore domain. The reasons for this are those mentioned earlier; it is dif-ﬁcult to know the extent of macropore ﬂow without detailed ﬁeld investigation.FUNDAMENTAL FORCES IN SOILSIn the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of capillary forces, referring to the example of water rising up a drinking straw (see p. 101, recap this before reading any further if you are unsure). You will recall that capillary forces are a consequence of the physics of small spaces. In small spaces such as soil and rock pores, surface tension (caused by cohesion within the liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid particles act together to move water against gravity. Importantly these forces also act to hold water against gravity. As was the case with the straws of differing diam-eter, these forces are more pronounced the smaller the spaces. Since there is a relationship between the size of grains and the pores that are formed between them, this means that there is a general relationship between grain size and capillarity or the strength of this suction; the ﬁner the grain size the stronger this force. In very ﬁne grained soils such as clays, we would therefore expect to see greater amounts of water held against gravity. Up until now we have explained capillary action only in terms of surface tension and adhesion. There is another important concept in capillary action, adsorption (note it is adsorption, not absorption which is something dif-ferent). Adsorption is the force exerted through the electrostatic attraction between the faces of solid particles (which often carry a charge) and water molecules, which as we established in Chapter 1, are dipolar. The structure of many clay minerals is laminar – they are comprised of layers of sili-cates with gaps between them sufﬁcient to allow water molecules to penetrate the structure of the mineral itself and become adsorbed to the internal surfaces (Figure 6.7). These internal surfaces can be signiﬁcant – consider the differences in speciﬁc underground waterways which can quickly convey water and can be as large as 50 cm to 1 m in diam-eter in some locations. The extent to which ﬂow in the macropore domain is signiﬁcant in a catch-ment depends on the extent to which they are con-nected. The more connected they are, the quicker the likely hydrological response of the catchment (the time difference between rain seeping into the ground and an observable response in the ﬂow in a channel). Because these structures are beneath the surface, it is very difﬁcult to know what the likely contribution via macropore ﬂow would be. These and other related challenges will be explored fur-ther in Chapter 7: Runoff.The second domain is the matrix domain. By this we mean the dominant structure and bulk of the soil. We would describe a soil as massive if there is no discernible structure in any direction and no evidence of cracks or macropores. Perme-ability in all directions is therefore likely to be low. Permeability, in the general sense, means how easy it is for water to pass through a medium. In some soils, the B horizon forms into columnar or blocky structures. These prismatic shaped peds have ver-tical cracks separating them, providing a preferen-tial pathway for ﬂow. We would therefore expect high vertical permeability. In other soil types, for example neutral or slightly alkaline soils, the bind-ing action of calcium and magnesium can result in soil particles grouping together as granules (Jones 1997). This granular or crumb-like structure leaves a network of spaces around the peds (interpedal macropores), which means that there is likely to be good permeability in all directions (isotropic permeability) ( Jones 1997). In other types of soil, structure arises in the form of horizontally arranged plate-like structures. Here, horizontal permeability will obviously be high.The key message from the discussion about the inﬂuence of soil structure on water movement is that we need to consider ﬂow in both the matrix and macropore domains. These are of course not independent, but inter-related, ﬂow pathways. When we simplify the complexity of soils by reduc-ing it to a number of key parameters (as we will do SOIL WATER117clays will swell and expand as a result. In addition to the capillary action arising from adsorption there is also the effect of surface tension and adhesion. As a result, clay can hold signiﬁcant quantities of water but adsorptive forces mean the water does not pass through, or leave, the clay easily. Bear in mind these fundamental forces as we consider rep-resenting soils in the next section by way of a few key parameters.Representing soil properties through key numerical conceptsPorosityYou will recall in the previous chapter we intro-duced the concept of porosity, which applies to both rock and soil. For convenience, we’ll repeat the basic deﬁnition here. This is deﬁned simply as the proportion of a soil or rock that consists of open spaces, and must therefore logically be the volume of the pores divided by the total volume of the rock or soil, often represented using the symbol ‘n’ (Equation 6.1).nVVpt= (6.1)Where n is porosity of a sample (dimensionless or e.g. cm3/cm3), Vp is the volume of pores in the sample (e.g. cm3) and Vt is the total volume of the sample (e.g. cm3). You will recall that porosity is usually expressed as a decimal fraction (between 0 and 1), but it can also be expressed as a percentage  (see Table 5.1 in the previous chapter for an indi-cation of the typical range in porosity of different types of rock and soil).SaturationWhen the volume of pores is completely ﬁlled with water, the soil is said to be saturated and this obvi-ously also deﬁnes the maximum amount of water that can be in a soil (saturated water content). One way of expressing soil water content is as a percentage surface (i.e. the total surface area per unit mass of material (m2/g)) in Table 6.1. There are orders of magnitude differences between coarse sand, ﬁne sand and silt, but many types of clays have surface areas several hundred times that of silt. The impor-tant point here is that water is able to penetrate the structure of many clays and there is a signiﬁcant internal structure for adsorption to occur on.

As indicated above, it is the strength of capillary forces that determines the amount of water at ﬁeld capacity (usually denoted by θfc), and consequently you would expect higher values of ﬁeld capacity for ﬁne grained materials such as clays. As was the case for calculating the amount of water at saturation in the example above, calculating the amount of water in a soil of known depth at ﬁeld capacity is just as straightforward. If θfc = 0.55 and the soil depth is 400 mm, there is an equivalent depth of water of 220 mm (0.55 × 400 mm = 220 mm).Wilting pointWilting point is a term derived from agriculture and refers to the soil water content when plants start to die back (wilt). This is signiﬁcant in hydrological processes as beyond this point the plants will no longer transpire. Some plants can recover from this point if water is provided, although for most plants experiencing moisture conditions towards this end of the soil moisture gradient invariably means that plant stress is occurring. If this is an agricultural crop there would be likely impacts in terms of crop yield and crop quality. Like porosity and ﬁeld capac-ity, θwp is also a decimal fraction. Although there is moisture in the soil below the wilting point, this moisture is held so tightly by the soil it is not acces-sible to plants, and would require oven drying to remove it. Because these values are on a moisture gradient, the following must hold true:nfcwp>>θθTable 6.2 provides typical values of porosity, ﬁeld capacity and wilting point for a range of soil tex-tural classes.Plant available waterPlant available water is simply the volume of water that plants have access to. This is also known as available water capacity. As indicated above, water of the saturated content and is a useful method of telling how wet the soil actually is.Volumetric soil water contentSoil water content is normally expressed as a vol-umetric soil moisture content or soil moisture fraction and given the Greek symbol theta (θ) – Equation 6.2.θ=VVwt (6.2)where Vw is the volume of water in a soil sample and Vt is the total volume of the soil sample.This is normally written as a decimal fraction (i.e. 0.4 = 40 per cent water by volume). As θ is a vol-ume divided by a volume it has no units, although it is sometimes denoted as m3/m3. If you know the depth of the soil, the volumetric water content of a soil can be converted into an equivalent depth of water and therefore easily related to other equiva-lent depths such as rainfall and evaporation. For example, if θ = 0.4 and the soil depth is 500 mm, there is an equivalent depth of water of 200 mm (0.4 × 500 mm = 200 mm). Thinking about the equivalent depth of water in the soil in this way is a fundamental approach in soil moisture budgeting and some types of hydrological modelling.Field capacityIn theory, water can ﬁll all of the pores in a soil; therefore porosity is the maximum potential volu-metric water content. In practice the volumetric soil moisture seldom reaches the porosity value and if it does, gravity acts on the water to force drain-age through the proﬁle that quickly drops mois-ture levels back below porosity. Field capacity is the stable point of saturation after rapid drainage, normally a day to a couple of days. In other words, ﬁeld capacity is the amount of water held back in the soil against gravity drainage by capillary forces, and for this reason, another term to describe this moisture state is the drained upper limit. Like SOIL WATER119
higher grain sizes, sand has a lower wilting point, but also a lower porosity, therefore also leading to low plant available water. Soils with the highest plant available water occur in the intermediate grain sizes, and these correspond to the loams pre-ferred for horticulture.Soil moisture deﬁcitSoil moisture deﬁcit is the amount of water required (in mm depth) to ﬁll the soil up to ﬁeld capacity. This is an important concept in both agriculture and hydrology. Efﬁcient irrigation, for example, should provide enough water to take the soil moisture to ﬁeld capacity. Any irrigation beyond this point leads to saturation (which may not be desirable for certain crops anyway), but more importantly will drain away and not be available to plants, representing ‘wasted’ water from an agri-cultural perspective and may contain soluble nutri-ents that can create problems from a water quality perspective. This is also an important hydrological parameter as it is often assumed that all rainfall inﬁltrates into a soil until the moisture content reaches ﬁeld capacity. The soil moisture deﬁcit at contents below wilting point is not available to plants, because it is bound too tightly to the soil. In contrast, water above ﬁeld capacity generally drains away rapidly, so in effect is not really available to plants. Logically then, the water that is available for transpiration is Equation 6.3:θθθpawfcwp=− (6.3)So, in a clay-loam soil that is 600 mm deep, with a ﬁeld capacity of 0.35 and a wilting point of 0.15, what is the plant available water? Remember that all these soil parameters represent proportions by volume, so if you know the depth of the soil you can easily turn this into an equivalent depth of water (θpaw = (600 mm × 0.35) – (600 mm × 0.15) = 120 mm).Figure 6.8 represents a more graphical view of data similar to that presented in Table 6.2. It can be seen that while a clay soil has a high porosity, it also has a high wilting point, which means low plant available water. This is because plants strug-gle to overcome the strong adhesive forces exerted by clay particles on the water held between them.

Figure 6.9 represents the various moisture con-dition parameters (saturation, ﬁeld capacity, wilt-ing point) using the analogy of a glass ﬁlled with water and ice cubes – where the ice cubes are the soil particles. The strength of soil suction at any point in time depends ﬁrstly on the pore size dis-tribution (i.e. determined by the textural properties of the soil) and secondly on the amount of water present in the soil. The annotation on the right of Figure 6.9 shows that when the soil is saturated, ψ = 0. Water between saturation and ﬁeld capacity is not held by capillary forces and is free to move (drain). For this reason, it is known as gravitational water. As discussed previously, water between the moisture conditions of ﬁeld capacity and wilting point is held by the soil, but is available for tran-spiration and is therefore plant available water. Notice though, that the negative pressure head (ψ) increases sharply from typically –340 cm of water at ﬁeld capacity to –15,000 cm of water at ﬁeld capacity. The latter value is the suction equivalent of the pressure exerted by a home espresso machine (15 bars). In other words, at wilting point, moisture gives an indication of how much rain is required before saturation, and therefore when overland ﬂow may occur (see Chapter 7). Soil moisture deﬁcit can be calculated by the following equation (Equa-tion 6.4), where θ is deﬁned as the current moisture condition:θθθsmdfc=− (6.4)Soil moisture tensionEarlier we explained why capillary action holds back water against gravity in soils (see ‘Funda-mental forces in soils’). When this force acts over an area, it is deﬁned as pressure (i.e. pressure is force per unit area). Capillary forces therefore result in suction (negative pressure), which is also referred to as soil moisture tension. This prop-erty of a soil can be measured directly (see later section on measurement). The symbol ψ (psi), is used to represent this negative pressure head and is also called matric suction, tension head or matric potential.Figure 6.8 The textural class of the soil determines the porosity, ﬁeld capacity and wilting point of the soil, which in turn determines the plant available water. Highest plant available water occurs in intermediate grain sizes.Source: Adapted from Ward and Trimble (2004)SandFinesandSandyloamFinesandy loanLoamSilty loamLight clay loamClay loamHeavyclay loamClayIncreasing water per unit of soilPlant available water (PAW)Field capacity (FC)
Wilting point (WP)SOIL WATER121So it is clear that reducing moisture conditions in the soil means that the water that is held there, is held by an ever-increasing force. In other words, this is a non-linear relationship. Earlier we said that this is also a function of the pore size distribution. This means that every type of soil will have its own characteristic relationship between moisture content and tension head or matric potential. These are called soil moisture curves (or suction– moisture curves) and are typically generalised per soil textural class. Figure 6.10 shows soil moisture curves for a clay and sand, representing the range in behaviours across soil textures.Although the soil moisture curves in Figure 6.10 are represented by a single line, it is a little more complicated than that. The shape of this curve actu-ally depends on whether you are measuring soil ten-sion as you are wetting the soil, or as you are drying it. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis,  and is related to the way that water enters and leaves pores. It takes a larger force for air to exit a  narrow pore neck (e.g. when it is drying out) than for water to enter (wetting) (Figure 6.11). Care must therefore be taken in interpreting a suction–moisture curve, as the method of measurement may have a large inﬂuence on the overall shape.Figure 6.9 Concepts of soil moisture illustrated using the analogy of a glass ﬁlled with ice and water, where the ice represents the soil particles. The ruler represents the fact that if something is known about the textural properties and depth of the soil, then the equivalent depth of water can be calculated (mm). On the right of the ﬁgure the effect of decreasing moisture condition on soil tension is shown, with reducing moisture conditions resulting in signiﬁcantly increasing soil moisture tension – water becomes increasingly tightly bound to the soil.

How does this inﬂuence movement of water in soil?In the previous chapter (groundwater), you were introduced to the concept of hydraulic head and Bernoulli’s equation. For movement in unsaturated soils, Equation 5.3 in the previous chapter (which was for saturated conditions), can be re-written as Equation 6.5:hz=+ψ (6.5)where h is the total potential (head), z is the gravita-tional potential and ψ is the matric potential.Water movement in soils therefore occurs as both a function of gravity and matric potential. At satu-ration, matric potential is zero, so ﬂow occurs as sat-urated ﬂow and according to Darcy’s Law. As soon as the soil is unsaturated, matric potential starts to counter the force of gravity, increasingly so as the soil dries. The implication of this is that hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soils (Kunsat) must vary, unlike saturated conditions in groundwater, where it is constant for a given material (Ksat). As can be seen in Figure 6.12, unsaturated hydraulic conduc-tivity changes in a non-linear way depending on the Figure 6.11 A generalised suction–moisture (or soil characteristic) curve for a soil.

How much water enters a soil during a certain time interval is known as the inﬁltration rate, and is dependent on the current water content of the soil and the ability of a soil to transmit the water. Although it is a property of the soil itself, it also depends importantly on the nature of the surface covering and is strongly inﬂuenced by the history of land management at the site. The rate at which this occurs in a rainfall event is not constant. Generally, water initially inﬁltrates at a faster rate and slows down with time (see Figure 6.13). When the inﬁltration rate slows down to a steady level (where the curve ﬂattens off in Figure 6.13) the inﬁltration capacity has been reached. This is the rate of inﬁltration when the soil is fully saturated. The terminology of inﬁltration capacity is mislead-ing as it suggests a capacity value rather than a rate. In fact, inﬁltration capacity is the inﬁltration rate when the soil is ﬁlled to capacity with water. The curves shown in Figure 6.13 are sometimes called the Philip curves, after Philip (1957) who built upon the pioneering work of Horton (1933) and provided sound theory for the inﬁltration of water.prevailing soil tension, which in turn depends on the soil moisture at any one time. Because hydraulic conductivity is a function of soil moisture which changes constantly in the soil, modelling move-ment of water in the unsaturated zone is much more complicated than for the saturated zone (ground-water). As the soil dries, hydraulic conductivity reduces in a non-linear way and water movement slows considerably. All other things being equal, movement of water under unsaturated conditions is much slower than saturated conditions. Conversely, small increases in water content can result in sig-niﬁcantly faster movement. This phenomenon also makes things numerically complex, and so Rich-ards’ approximation of Darcy’s equation is often used in unsaturated conditions. These additional complications are the reason we introduced you to the principles of groundwater ﬂow in the previous chapter ﬁrst.This brings us to the end of the section deal-ing with the fundamental forces and principles. We will now apply these principles in considering ﬁrstly how water enters the soil (inﬁltration) and secondly how it is then redistributed in the soil proﬁle (percolation or soil moisture redistribu-tion), some of which will enter the saturated zone and therefore become groundwater via recharge.

Biological action can be important in helping maintain an open soil structure, as can the pres-ence of organic matter which improves inﬁltration. Over-stocking and compaction by vehicles in con-trast can considerably reduce inﬁltration, which means that rather than replenishing soil moisture, rainfall just becomes surface runoff. Some types of clay soils are prone to cracking and crusting and others form surface seals, quite often due to the clay minerals present.The main force driving inﬁltration is gravity, but it may not be the only force. When soil is very dry it exerts suction that will draw the inﬁltrating water towards the drier area. Consider rain falling into the surface soil crack in Figure 6.15 – gravitational forces will draw the water downwards, but capillary forces will also be drawing the water laterally. As the moisture penetrates further, gravitational forces and capillary forces will be acting in the same direc-tion and drawing water downwards. With both of Inﬁltration capacity is sometimes referred to as the saturated hydraulic conductivity. This is not absolutely true as the measurement is dependent on the amount of water that may be ponded on the surface creating a high hydraulic head. Saturated hydraulic conductivity should be independent of this ponded head of water. There are conditions when inﬁltration capacity equals saturated hydrau-lic conductivity, but this is not always the case.Inﬁltration is strongly related to land use and land-cover. Figure 6.14, for example, shows that inﬁltration through old permanent pasture with heavy mulch (layer or organic matter) could have as much as seven times the inﬁltration after an hour in comparison with bare crusted ground.Other factors, such as antecedent moisture condition are also important. The antecedent moisture condition refers to how wet the soil already was at the start of a rainfall event. A drier soil will have faster inﬁltration than a wetter soil.

These are essentially two different types of macropores: those large pores within the soil matrix (matrix domain); and those that are essentially separated from the matrix (mac-ropore domain).In ﬂat areas of the landscape, the direction of water movement will obviously be vertically down-wards. On slopes there will be elements of vertical and downslope movement, the net movement being the vector of the vertical and slope characteristics. Flow downslope is called lateral ﬂow, transverse ﬂow or interﬂow.When surface soil is drier than deeper soil, water movement can be in the opposite direction against gravity. You will recall this also occurs at the water table, where the capillary fringe deﬁnes the tran-sitional area between the phreatic and vadose zones. Where soil water moves back onto the surface from the soil zone, this is known as exﬁltration and as we will see in the next chapter, can be important in surface runoff.MEASUREMENT OF WATER IN THE SOILMeasuring soil moistureAlthough the earlier section referred to volumet-ric water content, another way of representing soil water content is in relation to its mass. This is known as gravimetric soil moisture content (G). Gravimetric soil moisture content is the ratio of the weight of water in a soil to the overall weight of the soil (Equation 6.6):GMMMwddbw=−=θρρ (6.6)where G is the gravimetric water content (g/g), Mw is the mass of the wet sample, and Md is the mass of the dry sample. The second part of the equation shows how gravimetric and volumetric soil water content can be related to each other by the soil bulk density: the density of soil in situ and where ρb is the bulk density of soil (g/cm3); and ρw is the these forces acting in concert, the inﬁltrating water moves down through the soil proﬁle in a wetting front. The wetting front is three-dimensional, as the water moves outwards as well as vertically down. The shape of the curve in Figure 6.13 is related to the speed at which the wetting front is moving. It slows down the further it gets away from the surface as it takes longer for the water at the surface to feed the front (and as the front increases in size).The ability of a soil to transmit water is depen-dent on the pore sizes within it and most impor-tantly on the connections between pores. Pores can be classiﬁed according to size or function (McLaren and Cameron 1996). Macropores are deﬁned as pores greater than 30 µm (microns) in diameter but can also be deﬁned by their drainage characteristic (the amount of pressure required to remove water from the pore). A well-structured soil consists of stable aggregates with a wide range of pore sizes within and between the aggregates. In this case macropores may make up at least 10 per cent of this soil volume. This structure provides numerous interconnected pathways for the ﬂow of water with a wide range of velocities. In less well-structured soils, biological activity (e.g. roots and worms) can produce macropores that provide ﬂowpaths for water that are largely separated from the main soil Figure 6.15 A neutron probe sitting on an access tube. The black cable extends down into the tube with the source of fast neutrons (and counter) at the tip.
126SOIL WATERvolume of soil (cm3); Mw is the mass of water (g); and Md is the mass of dry soil (g). The density of water is close to 1 g/cm3 so the weight of water can be assumed to equal the volume of water; hence the ≈ symbol in the equation above.Gravimetric analysis is simple and accurate but does have several drawbacks. Most notable of these is that it is a destructive sampling method and there-fore it cannot be repeated on the same soil sample. This may be a problem where there is a require-ment for long-term monitoring of soil moisture. In this case a non-destructive moisture-sampling method is required. There are three methods that ﬁt this bill, but they are indirect estimates of soil moisture rather than direct measurements as they rely on measuring other properties of soil in water. The three methods are: neutron probes, electrical resistance blocks and time domain reﬂectometry. All of these can give good results for monitoring soil moisture content, but are indirect and require calibration against the gravimetric technique.Neutron probeA neutron probe has a radioactive source that is lowered into an augured hole; normally the hole is kept in place as a permanent access tube using alu-minium tubing. The radioactive source emits fast (or high energy) neutrons that collide with soil and water particles. The fast neutrons are very similar in size to a hydrogen ion (H+ formed in the disas-sociation of the water molecule) so that when they collide the fast neutron slows down and the hydro-gen ion speeds up. In contrast, when a fast neutron collides with a much larger soil particle it bounces off with very little loss of momentum. The analogy can be drawn to a pool table. When the cue ball (i.e. a fast neutron) collides with a coloured pool ball (i.e. a water particle) they both move off at similar speeds, the cue ball has slowed down and the coloured ball has speeded up. In contrast, if the cue ball hits the cushion on the edge of a pool table (i.e. a soil particle) it bounces off with very little loss of speed. Consequently the more water there is in a soil the more fast neutrons would slow down density of water (g/cm3). As the density of water is close to 1 g/cm3 it can be ignored. Soil bulk density (ρb) is the ratio of the mass of dry soil to the total volume of the soil (Equation 6.7).ρbdtMV= (6.7)As described above, the density of water is very close to 1 g/cm3 (but temperature dependent; see Figure 1.3), therefore the weight of water is often assumed to be the same as the volume of water. The same cannot be said for soil: the bulk density depends on the mineralogy and packing of particles so that the volume does not equal the weight. Soil bulk density gives an indication of soil compaction with a cultivated topsoil having a value of around 1 g/cm3 and a compacted subsoil being as high as 1.6 g/cm3 (McLaren and Cameron 1996). It is important to note that because of this, gravimetric soil moisture content is not the same as volumetric soil moisture content, and care must be taken in distinguishing between them as they are not inter-changeable terms. These concepts underpin the gravimetric method outlined below.Gravimetric methodThe simplest and most accurate means for the measurement of soil water is using the gravimetric method. This involves taking a soil sample, weigh-ing it wet, drying in an oven and then weighing it dry. Standard practice for the drying of soils is 24 hours at 105 °C (Gardner 1986). The difference between the wet and dry weights tells you how wet the soil was. If it is volumetric soil moisture con-tent that is required then you must take a sample of known volume. This is commonly done using an undisturbed soil sample and utilising Equation 6.8.θ=≈−VVMMVwtwdt (6.8)Where θ i s  t h e  v o l u m e t r i c  w a t e r  c o n t e n t  ( c m3/ cm3); Vw is the volume of water (cm3); Vt is the total SOIL WATER127For this instrumentation two small blocks of gyp-sum are inserted into the soil and a continuous measurement of electrical resistance between the blocks is recorded. The measure of electrical resis-tance can be calibrated against gravimetric analysis of soil moisture. The continuity of measurement in electrical resistance blocks is a great advantage of the method, but there are several problems in interpreting the data. The main difﬁculty is that the conductivity of the water is dependent on the amount of dissolved ions contained within it. If this varies, say through the application of fertil-iser, then the electrical resistance will decrease in a manner unrelated to the amount of water pres-ent. The second major difﬁculty is that the gypsum blocks deteriorate with time so that their electri-cal conductivity alters. This makes for a gradually changing signal, requiring constant recalibration. The ideal situation for the use of electrical resis-tance blocks is where they do not sit in wet soil for long periods and the water moving through the soil is of relatively constant dissolved solids load. An example of this type of situation is in sand dunes, but these are not particularly representative of general land use.Time domain reﬂectometryTime domain reﬂectometry (TDR) is a more recent soil moisture measurement technique. The prin-ciple of measurement is that as a wave of electro-magnetic energy is passed through a soil the wave properties will alter. The way that these wave prop-erties alter will vary, dependent on the water con-tent of the soil. TDR measures the properties of microwaves as they are passed through a soil and relates this to the soil moisture content. Although this sounds relatively simple it is a complicated technique that requires detailed electronic tech-nology. Up until the late 1990s this had restricted the usage of TDR to laboratory experiments but there are now soil moisture probes available that are small, robust and reliable in a ﬁeld situation. An example of this is the Theta probe shown in Figure 6.16.to become ‘slow neutrons’. A neutron probe counts the number of slow neutrons returning towards the radioactive tip, and this can be related to the soil moisture content. The neutron probe readings need to be calibrated against samples of soil with known moisture contents. This is often done by using gravimetric analysis on the samples collected while the access tubes are being put in place. It is also possible to calibrate the probe using reconstituted soil in a drum or similar vessel. It is important that the calibration occurs on the soil actually being measured, since the fast:slow neutron ratio will vary according to mineralogy of the soil.Although the neutron probe is essentially non-destructive in its measurement of soil water con-tent, it is not continuous. There is a requirement for an operator to spend time in the ﬁeld taking measurements at set intervals. This may present difﬁculties in the long-term monitoring of soil moisture. Another difﬁculty with a neutron probe is that the neutrons emitted from the radioactive tip move outwards in a spherical shape. When the probe tip is near the surface some of the sphere of neutrons will leave the soil and enter the atmo-sphere, distorting the reading of returning slow neutrons. A very careful calibration has to take place for near-surface readings and caution must be exercised when interpreting these results. This is unfortunate as it is often the near-surface soil moisture content that is of greatest importance. Although neutron probes are reliable instruments for the monitoring of soil moisture, the cost of the instruments, difﬁculties over installing access tubes (Figure 6.15), calibration problems and the near-surface problem have meant that they have seldom been used outside a research environment.Electrical resistance blocksElectrical resistance blocks use a measurement of electrical resistance to infer the water content of a soil. As water is a conductor of electricity it is reasonable to assume that the more water there is in a soil the lower the electrical resistance, or conversely, the higher the electrical conductivity. 128SOIL WATERthe moisture content. By steadily increasing the air pressure between soil moisture measurements, a suction–moisture curve can be derived. This can be interpreted to give important information on soil pore sizes and is also important for deriving an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity value for a given soil moisture (Klute 1986).Measuring inﬁltrationInﬁltration rate is measured by recording the rate at which water enters the soil. There are numerous methods available to do this, the simplest being a ring inﬁltrometer (see Figure 6.17). A solid ring is pushed into the ground and a pond of water sits on the soil (within the ring). This pond of water is kept at a steady level by a reservoir held above the ring. Recordings of the level of water in the reservoir (with time) give a record of the inﬁltration rate. To turn the inﬁltration volume into an inﬁltration depth the volume of water needs to be divided by the cross-sectional area of the ring.A simple ring inﬁltrometer provides a measure of the ponded inﬁltration rate, but there are several associated problems. The ﬁrst is that by using a sin-gle ring a large amount of water may escape around the sides of the ring, giving higher readings than would be obtained from a completely saturated sur-face. To overcome this a double ring inﬁltrometer is sometimes used. With this, a second wider ring is placed around the ﬁrst and ﬁlled with water so that the area surrounding the measured ring is continu-ally wet. The second problem is that ponded inﬁl-tration is a relatively rare event across a catchment. It is more common for rainfall to inﬁltrate directly without causing a pond to form on the surface. To overcome this a rainfall simulator may be used to provide the inﬁltrating water.Estimating soil waterIn the previous section it was stated that several of the methods listed were indirect measurement methods or estimation techniques. They certainly do not measure soil moisture content directly, but Measuring soil suctionA tensiometer is used to measure the soil suction pressure or soil moisture tension. This is the force exerted by capillary forces and it increases as the soil dries out. A tensiometer is a small ceramic cup on the end of a sealed tube of water. The dry soil attempts to suck the water from the water-ﬁlled tube through the ceramic cup. At the top of the tube a diaphragm measures the pressure exerted by this suction. Tensiometers also have the ability to measure a positive pressure when the soil water is held under pressure (e.g. during a rising water table). The units of soil suction are Pascals, the SI units for pressure.A suction–moisture curve (see Figure 6.11) can also be derived for a soil sample using a pres-sure plate apparatus. This uses a pressure cham-ber to increase the air pressure surrounding a soil sample and force water out of pores and through a ceramic plate at its base. When no more water can be forced out then it is assumed that the capil-lary forces (i.e. the soil suction) equal the air pres-sure and the sample can be weighed to measure Figure 6.16 The Theta probe (manufactured by Delta-T devices).

SOIL WATER129from rainfall) and outﬂows (seepage and evapora-tion) to derive a soil water storage value for a given time and space.Remote sensing of soil moistureIn the last decade, signiﬁcant advances in the ﬁeld of remote sensing have allowed for increasingly accurate soil moisture measurements to be obtained by satellites. Both active and passive sensors can provide valuable information of soil moisture at medium-high resolution. The advantage of any remote sensing technique is that it samples over a wide spatial area. Satellites measure the elec-tromagnetic radiation within each pixel; this is an average value for the whole area, rather than a point measurement that might be expected from normal soil moisture measurements. The question that needs to be answered before satellite remote sensing is widely accepted in hydrology is whether the enhanced spatial distribution of measurement is sufﬁcient to overcome the limitations of direct soil moisture measurement. The key limitation being that to date, sensors can only produce accurate soil moisture measurements at the very near surface (i.e. within the top 5 cm), which is a restriction on their application in hydrological science. However, this is an important area in the generation of runoff (see Chapter 7) and is still worthy of measurement.Passive sensorsPassive sensors rely on natural light to produce multispectral imagery (MSI) of the Earth’s surface. While the common primary use of MSI is high res-olution landcover mapping and the monitoring of vegetation/water conditions, it is possible to make estimates of soil moisture using MSI. For exam-ple, studies have shown that where soil moisture is within the range available to plants (i.e. plant available water) vegetation indices, such as the Moisture Stress Index (MSI) and Normalised Dif-ference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are highly cor-related with measured soil moisture in the surface horizons (Wang et al. 2007; Gu et al. 2008). As a

A reading of water volume in the reservoir is taken and the time recorded.they have a good degree of accuracy and are good measures of soil moisture, albeit in a surrogate form. Estimating the amount of water beneath the surface can also be carried out using either numeri-cal modelling or remote sensing techniques. The main groundwater modelling techniques focus on the movement of water in the subsurface zone, using different forms of Darcy’s law (e.g. Richards equation). There are also models of soil water bal-ance that rely on calculating inﬂows (inﬁltration 130SOIL WATERvegetation cover the radar backscatter has been well correlated with surface moisture (Grifﬁths and Wooding 1996; Kelly et al. 2003). Soil mois-ture content within the surface zone also inﬂuences the backscattering of radiation from a sensor as the soil dielectric properties change with variations in water content.Commonly applied satellites which produce soil moisture measurements are the European Remote Sensing platforms (ERS-1 and ERS-2), the METeoro-logical OPerational satellite (METOP), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. Launched in early 2015, SMAP was well positioned to revo-lutionise the ﬁeld of soil moisture remote sensing through its unique combination of passive and active sensors with high spatial and temporal resolution. NASA hoped that SMAP would allow scientists to further our understanding of processes that link the terrestrial energy, water and carbon cycles. However only months into its 3-year mission, the radar on board SMAP suddenly stopped operating and was deemed unrepairable by ground teams. On launch there was an expectation that SMAP would produce both 9-km and 36-km global soil moisture datasets. With the loss of the radar, only the 36-km dataset is currently available. This dataset (and others from the SMAP mission) are available to download here: https://nsidc.org/data/smap/smap-data.html. There are plans to fuse SMAP datasets with those produced by other radar satellites (such as the European Space Agency Sentinel-1) to create a global scale, high resolution soil moisture product.result, NDVI from a range of sensors are key inputs into national drought monitoring systems, such as the US Drought Monitor (Brown et al. 2008) and the African Flood and Drought Monitor (Shefﬁeld et al. 2014).Beyond the multispectral region of the electro-magnetic spectrum (EMS), thermal remote sensing also offers opportunities for the measurement of soil moisture. The high heat capacity of water means that it has considerable effect on the emission of thermal infrared signals from the earth. These can be detected by satellites and an inference made about how wet the soil is. This is especially so if two images of the same scene can be compared in order to derive a relative wetness. Satellite platforms like Landsat and SPOT are able to use this technique at spatial resolutions of around 10–30 m.The major limitation with any passive remote sensing approaches is that they rely on a lack of cloud cover over the site of investigation, some-thing that is not easy to guarantee, especially in hydrologically active (i.e. wet) areas.Active sensorsActive sensors emit microwaves from a satellite and the strength of returning signal measured. This is a complex radar system and has only been available on satellites since the early 1990s. The strength of microwave backscatter is primarily dependent on two factors. Firstly soil roughness; where soil roughness is well known and there is little or no Case studyREMOTE SENSING OF SOIL MOISTURE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR FIELDWORKRemote sensing of soil moisture may offer a way of deriving important hydrological infor-mation without intensive, and costly, fieldwork programmes.

The amount of water within a river or stream is of great interest to hydrologists. It represents the end-product of all the other processes in the hydrologi-cal cycle and is where the largest amount of effort has gone into analysis of historical records. The methods of analysis are covered next in Chapter 9, whereas this chapter deals with the mechanisms that lead to water entering the stream: the runoff mechanisms. Runoff is a loose term that covers the movement of water to a channelised stream, after it has reached the ground as precipitation. The move-ment can occur either on or below the surface and at differing velocities. This is an important point; most people think of runoff in the sense of surface runoff, but the term includes water moving downslope within the soil proﬁle, and of course groundwater ﬂow (Chapter 5). Once the water reaches a stream it moves towards the oceans in a channelised form, the process referred to as streamﬂow, channel ﬂow or riverﬂow. Streamﬂow is expressed as discharge: the volume of water over a deﬁned time period. The SI units for discharge are m3/s (colloquially referred to as cumecs). A continuous record of streamﬂow is called a hydrograph (see Figure 7.1). Although we think of this as continuous measurement, it is normally either an averaged ﬂow over a time period or a series of samples (e.g. a measurement every 15 minutes). Often the y-axis of a hydrograph is plotted on a logarithmic scale. If hydrographs are  plotted on a normal scale, showing the less frequent but high ﬂow events means that much of the ‘nor-mal’ lower ﬂows are plotted very close to the x-axis 134RUNOFFat the National River Flow Archive (CEH 2015), https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/). What differs principally is their underlying geology. The rocks of the Lam-bourn are virtually all high permeability chalk, whilst the Ock has some chalk but also bedrock of lower permeabilities.Figure 7.3 shows the shape of a storm hydro-graph in detail. There are several important hydro-logical terms that can be seen in this diagram. The rising limb of the hydrograph is the initial steep part leading up to the highest or peakﬂow value. The water contributing to this part of the hydrograph is from rapid runoff mechanisms and channel precipitation (i.e. rain that falls directly onto the channel). Some texts claim that channel pre-cipitation shows up as a preliminary blip before the main rising limb. In reality this is very rarely observed, a factor of the complicated nature of storm runoff processes. The recession limb of the hydrograph is after the peak and is characterised by a longer, slower decrease in streamﬂow until the baseﬂow is reached again. The recession limb is attenuated by two factors: storm water arriving at the mouth of a catchment from the furthest parts, and the arrival of water that has moved as subsurface ﬂow at a slower rate than the stream-ﬂow. The time difference between the peakﬂow value and the rainfall event driving the ﬂow is the lag and is also a function of the same catchment physical properties that determine the shape of the hydrograph. The area under the curve above the dotted baseﬂow line represents the stormﬂow volume (m3).Exactly how water moves from precipitation reaching the ground surface to channelised stream-ﬂow is one of the most intriguing hydrological questions, and one that cannot be answered easily. Much research effort in the past hundred years has gone into understanding runoff mechanisms; con-siderable advances have been made, but there are still many unanswered questions. The following section describes how it is thought runoff occurs, but there are many different scales at which these mechanisms are evident and they do not occur everywhere.and are difﬁcult to see. Taking the logarithm of the ﬂow and plotting that, allows the richness of the hydrograph to be visualised.In Figure 7.1, there are a series of peaks between periods of steady, much lower ﬂows. The hydro-graph peaks are referred to as peakﬂow, storm-ﬂow or even quickﬂow. They are the water in the stream during and immediately after a signiﬁcant rainfall event. The steady periods between peaks are referred to as baseﬂow or sometimes delayed ﬂow or slowﬂow (N.B. this is different from low ﬂow; see Chapter 9).The shape of a hydrograph, and in particular the shape of the stormﬂow peak, is inﬂuenced by the storm characteristics (e.g. rainfall intensity and duration) and many physical characteristics of the upstream catchment. In terms of catchment char-acteristics, the largest inﬂuence is exerted by catch-ment size, but other factors include slope, shape of catchment, soil type, geology, vegetation type and percentage cover, hydraulic length, drainage density, degree of urbanisation and the anteced-ent soil moisture. The signiﬁcant effect catchment characteristics can have on streamﬂow is illustrated for the Lambourne at Shaw and the Ock at Abing-don in Figure 7.2. Both these are similarly sized (234km2) sub-catchments of the Thames, UK – and as directly neighbouring catchments, they share a virtually identical climate (see data for each station Figure 7.1 A typical hydrograph, taken from the river Wye, Wales for a 100-day period during the autumn of 1995.

when the rainfall rate was higher than the inﬁltra-tion rate of a soil. Horton went on to suggest that under these circumstances the excess rainfall col-lected on the surface before travelling towards the stream as a thin sheet of water moving across the surface. Under this hypothesis it is the inﬁltration rate of a soil that acts as a controlling barrier or partitioning device. Where the inﬁltration capacity of a soil is low, overland ﬂow occurs readily. This type of overland ﬂow is referred to as inﬁltration excess overland ﬂow o r  Hortonian overland ﬂow although as Beven (2004) points out, Horton himself referred to it as ‘rainfall excess’. Horton’s view that the storm response of catchments was dominated by overland ﬂow remained the domi-nant theory for decades (Bevan 2006).Horton’s ideas were extremely important in hydrology as they represented the ﬁrst serious attempt to understand the processes of storm run-off that lead to a storm hydrograph. However, when people started to measure inﬁltration capacities of soils they invariably found that they were far higher RUNOFF MECHANISMSFigure 7.4 is an attempt to represent the different runoff processes that can be observed at the hillslope scale. Overland ﬂow (Qo) is the water which runs across the surface of the land before reaching the stream. In the subsurface, throughﬂow (Qt) (some authors refer to this as lateral ﬂow or transverse ﬂow) occurs in the shallow subsurface, predomi-nantly, although not always, in the unsaturated zone. Groundwater ﬂow (QG) is in the deeper satu-rated zone. All of these are runoff mechanisms that contribute to streamﬂow. The relative importance of each is dependent on the catchment under study and the rainfall characteristics during a storm.Overland ﬂowSome of the earliest research work on how over-land ﬂow occurs was undertaken by Robert Hor-ton (1875–1945). In a classic paper from 1933, Horton hypothesised that overland ﬂow occurred Figure 7.3 A schematic storm hydrograph.

than most normal rainfall rates. This is illustrated in Table 7.1 where some typical inﬁltration capaci-ties and rainfall rates are shown. Other measure-ments conﬁrm high inﬁltration capacities for soils, e.g. Selby (1970) reports inﬁltration capacities of between 60 and 600 mm/hour on short grazed pas-ture on yellow-brown pumice soils in the central North Island of New Zealand. The values were higher for ungrazed grass and under trees and are generally higher than the measured rainfall intensi-ties (Selby 1970).In addition to the inﬁltration capacity infor-mation, it is extremely rare to ﬁnd a thin sheet of water moving over the surface during a storm event. It was observations such as those by Hursh (1944) and others that subsequently led to a gen-eral revision of Horton’s hypothesis. Hursh (1944), for example, recognised that ﬂows other than sur-face ﬂow might be important, and coined the term ‘subsurface-stormﬂow’. His 1944 paper considered how subsurface ﬂow might be relevant in the storm hydrograph (Bevan 2006). Cook (1946) proposed that overland ﬂow could also be generated by sub-surface ﬂow that re-emerges onto the land surface, Figure 7.4 Hillslope runoff processes.

However, one of the ﬁrst to ques-tion the dominance of Horton’s hypothesis (at least in print – as Bevan (2006) points out) was Roger Betson. In his study catchments, Betson (1964) showed that storm runoff was being generated from relatively small parts of these catchments. His proposition was that within a catchment there are only limited (partial) areas that contribute overland ﬂow to a storm hydrograph. This is referred to as 138RUNOFFis referred to as the variable source areas concept. This goes a step beyond the ideas of Betson (1964) as the catchment has a partial areas response but the response area is dynamic; i.e. variable in space and time.So who was right: Horton, or Hewlett and Hib-bert? The answer is that both were. Table 7.2 provides a summary of the ideas for storm runoff generation described here. It is now accepted that saturated overland ﬂow (Hewlett and Hibbert) is the dominant overland ﬂow mechanism in humid, mid-latitude areas. It is also accepted that the vari-able source areas concept is the most valid descrip-tion of stormﬂow processes. However, where the inﬁltration capacity of a soil is low or the rainfall rates are high, Hortonian overland ﬂow does occur. In Table 7.1 it can be seen that there are times when rainfall intensities will exceed inﬁltration rates under natural circumstances. It is also important to note that these processes could be occurring at the same time in the same catchment. In arid and semi-arid zones it is not uncommon to ﬁnd extremely high rainfall rates (fed by convective storms) that can lead to inﬁltration excess overland ﬂow and rapid ﬂood events; this is called ﬂash ﬂooding.Examples of low inﬁltration rates can be found with compacted soils (e.g. from vehicle movements in an agricultural ﬁeld), on roads and paved areas, on heavily crusted soils and what are referred to as hydrophobic soils.Basher and Ross (2001) reported inﬁltration capacities of 400 mm/hour in market gardens in the North Island of New Zealand and that these rates increased during the growing season to as high as 900 mm/hour. However, Basher and Ross (2001) also showed a decline in inﬁltration the partial areas concept. Betson did not chal-lenge the role of inﬁltration excess overland ﬂow as the primary source of stormﬂow, but did challenge the idea of overland ﬂow occurring as a thin sheet of water throughout a catchment.Hewlett and Hibbert (1967) were the ﬁrst to suggest that there might be another generally applicable mechanism of overland ﬂow occurring. In contrast to Horton who worked in a more arid part of the USA, Hewlett and Hibbert were part of a group of forest hydrologists that had for some time been less convinced of the applicability of his theory in more temperate areas. This was particu-larly based on the observations from the eastern USA: that during a storm it was common to ﬁnd all the rainfall inﬁltrating a soil. Hewlett and Hibbert (1967) hypothesised that during a rainfall event all the water inﬁltrated the surface. This hypothesis was conﬁrmed by a comprehensive ﬁeld study by Dunne and Black (1970).Through a mixture of inﬁltration and through-ﬂow, the water table would rise until in some places it reached the surface. At this stage overland ﬂow occurs as a mixture of return ﬂow (i.e. water that has been beneath the ground but returns to the surface) and rainfall falling on saturated areas. This type of overland ﬂow is referred to as saturated overland ﬂow. Hewlett and Hibbert (1967) suggested that the water table was closest to the surface, and there-fore likely to rise to the surface quickest, adjacent to stream channels and at the base of slopes. Their ideas on stormﬂow were that the areas contributing water to the hydrograph peaks were the saturated zones, and that these vary from storm to storm. In effect the saturated areas immediately adjacent to the stream act as extended channel networks.

Subsequent work by the likes of Dunne and Black (1970), Anderson and Burt (1978) and others has identiﬁed other areas in a catchment prone to inducing saturated overland ﬂow. These include areas where there is convergence of ﬂow e.g. hillslope hollows, slope concavities (in section) (Figure 7.5a), or where there is a thinning of the soil overlying an impermeable base (Figure 7.5c). Simi-larly where a change of slope results in a reduction of hydraulic gradient (Figure 7.5b) or a change in hydraulic conductivity (Figure 7.5d), any through-ﬂow is likely to return to the surface as the vol-ume of soil receiving it is not large enough for the amount of water entering it. This can be commonly observed in the ﬁeld where wet and boggy areas can be found at the base of slopes and at valley heads (hillslope hollows). Because these areas may not be capacity to as low as 0.5 mm/hour in wheel tracks at the same site.Hydrophobic soils have a peculiar ability to swell rapidly on contact with water, which can create an impermeable barrier at the soil surface to inﬁltrat-ing water, leading to Hortonian overland ﬂow. The cause of hydrophobicity in soils has been linked to several factors including the presence of mycor-rhizal fungi and swelling clays such as allophane (Doerr et al. 2007). Hydrophobicity is a temporary soil property; continued contact with water will increase the inﬁltration rate. For example Clothier et al. (2000) showed how a yellow brown earth/loam changed from an initial inﬁltration capacity of 2 mm/hour to 14 mm/hour as the soil hydrophobic-ity breaks down.In Hewlett and Hibbert’s (1967) original hypoth-esis it was suggested that contributing saturated

140RUNOFFmoves down slope. However, the movement of water through a saturated soil matrix is not rapid, e.g. Kelliher and Scotter (1992) report a Ksat value of 13 mm/hour for a ﬁne sandy loam. In order for throughﬂow to contribute to storm runoff there must be another mechanism (other than matrix ﬂow) operating.One of the ﬁrst theories put forward concern-ing the contribution of throughﬂow to a storm hydrograph was by Horton and Hawkins (1965) (this Horton was a different person from the proposer of Hortonian overland ﬂow). They pro-posed the mechanism of translatory or piston ﬂow to explain the rapid movement of water from the subsurface to the stream. They suggested that as water enters the top of a soil column it displaces the water at the bottom of the column (i.e. old water), and the displaced water enters the stream. The analogy is drawn to a piston where pressure at the top of the piston chamber leads to a release of pressure at the bottom. The release of water to the stream can be modelled as a pressure wave rather than tracking individual particles of water. Piston ﬂow has been observed in laboratory experiments with soil columns (e.g. Germann and Beven 1981).At ﬁrst glance the simple piston analogy seems unlike a real-life situation, since a hillslope is not bounded by impermeable sides in the same way as a piston chamber. However, the theory is not as farfetched as it may seem, as the addition of rain-fall inﬁltrating across a complete hillslope is analo-gous to pressure being applied from above and in this case the boundaries are upslope (i.e. gravity) and the bedrock below. Brammer and McDonnell (1996) suggest that this may be a mechanism for the rapid movement of water along the bedrock and soil interface on the steep catchment of Maimai in New Zealand. In this case it is the hydraulic gradi-ent created by an addition of water to the bottom of the soil column, already close to saturated, that forces water along the base where hydraulic conduc-tivities are higher.Ward (1984) draws the analogy of a thatched roof to describe the contribution of subsurface ﬂow to a stream (based on the ideas of Zaslavsky immediately adjacent to streamside variable source areas they are called disjunct source areas, but for them to contribute to stormﬂow, they would need to have effective hydrological connections with val-ley bottoms (Robinson and Ward 2017).Subsurface ﬂowUnder the variable source areas concept there are places within a catchment that contribute overland ﬂow to the storm hydrograph. When we total up the amount of water found in a storm hydrograph it is difﬁcult to believe that it has all come from overland ﬂow, especially when this is conﬁned to a relatively small part of the catchment (i.e. variable source areas concept). The more gradual manner in which the recession limb of a hydrograph attenu-ates the storm-ﬂow suggests that it may be derived from a slower movement of water: subsurface ﬂow. In addition to this, tracer studies looking at where the water has been before entering the stream as stormﬂow have found that a large amount of the storm hydrograph consists of ‘old water’ (e.g. Mar-tinec et al. 1974; Fritz et al. 1976). This old water has been sitting in the soil, or as fully saturated groundwater, for a considerable length of time and yet enters the stream during a storm event. There have been several theories put forward to try and explain these ﬁndings, almost all involving throughﬂow and groundwater.Throughﬂow is a general term used to describe the movement of water through the unsaturated zone; normally this is the soil matrix. Once water inﬁl-trates the soil surface it continues to move, either through the soil matrix or along preferential ﬂow paths (referred to as lateral or preferential ﬂow). The rate of soil water movement through a saturated soil matrix is described by Darcy’s law (see Chap-ter 5) and the Richards approximation of Darcy’s law when below saturation. Under normal, vertical, inﬁltration conditions the hydraulic gradient has a value of –1 and the saturated hydraulic conductiv-ity is the inﬁltration capacity. Once the soil is satu-rated, the movement of water is not only vertical. With a sloping water table on a hillslope, water RUNOFF141Groundwater contribution to stormﬂowAnother possible explanation for the presence of old water in a storm hydrograph is that it comes from the saturated zone (groundwater) rather than from throughﬂow. This is contrary to conventional hydro-logical wisdom which suggests that groundwater contributes to baseﬂow but not to the stormﬂow com-ponent of a hydrograph. Although a groundwater con-tribution to stormﬂow had been suggested before, it was not until Sklash and Farvolden (1979) provided a theoretical mechanism for this to occur that the idea was seriously considered. They proposed the capillary fringe hypothesis to explain the groundwater ridge, a rise in the water table immediately adjacent to a stream (as observed by Ragan 1968). Sklash and Far-volden (1979) suggested that the addition of a small amount of inﬁltrating rainfall to the zone immediately adjacent to a stream causes the soil water to move from an unsaturated state (i.e. under tension) to a saturated state (i.e. a positive pore pressure expelling water). As explained in Chapter 6, the relationship between soil water content and soil water tension is non-linear. The addition of a small amount of water can cause a rapid change in soil moisture status from unsaturated to saturated. This provides the groundwater ridge which:not only provides the early increased impetus for the displacement of the groundwater already in a discharge position, but it also results in an increase in the size of the groundwater discharge area which is essential in pro-ducing large groundwater contributions to the stream.(Sklash and Farvolden 1979: 65)An important point to stress from the capillary fringe hypothesis is that the groundwater ridge is developing well before any throughﬂow may have been received from the contributing hillslope areas. These ideas conﬁrm the variable source areas con-cept and provide a mechanism for a signiﬁcant old water contribution to storm hydrographs. Field studies such as that by McDonnell (1990) have observed groundwater ridging to a limited extent, although it is not an easy task as often the instru-ment response time is too slow to detect the rapid change in pore pressure properly.and Sinai (1981)). When straw is placed on a sloping roof it is very efﬁcient at moving water to the bottom of the roof (the guttering being analogous to a stream) without visible overland ﬂow. This is due to the preferential ﬂow direc-tion along, rather than between, sloping straws. Measurements of hillslope soil properties do show a higher hydraulic conductivity in the downslope rather than vertical direction. This would account for a movement of water downslope as through-ﬂow, but it is still bound up in the soil matrix and reasonably slow.There is considerable debate on the role of mac-ropores in the rapid movement of water through the soil matrix. Macropores are larger pores within a soil matrix, typically with a diameter greater than 3 mm. They may be caused by soils cracking, worms burrowing or other biotic activities. The main interest in them from a hydrologic point of view is that they provide a rapid conduit for the movement of water through a soil. The main area of contention concerning macropores is whether they form continuous networks allowing rapid move-ment of water down a slope or not. There have been studies suggesting macropores as a major mechanism contributing water to stormﬂow (e.g. Mosley 1979, 1982; Wilson et al. 1990), but it is difﬁcult to detect whether these are from small areas on a hillslope or continuous throughout. Jones (1981) and Tanaka (1992) summarise the role of pipe networks (a form of continuous macropores) in hillslope hydrology. Where found, pipe networks have considerable effect on the subsurface hydrol-ogy but they are not a common occurrence in the ﬁeld situation.The role of macropores in runoff generation is unclear. Although they are capable of allowing rapid movement of water towards a stream channel there is little evidence of networks of macropores moving large quantities of water in a continuous fashion. Where macropores are known to have a sig-niﬁcant role is in the rapid movement of water to the saturated layer (e.g. Heppell et al. 1999) which may in turn lead to piston ﬂow (McGlynn et al. 2002).142RUNOFFCase studyTHE MAIMAI RUNOFF GENERATION STUDIESThe Maimai catchment study (near Reefton on the west coast of the South Island of New Zea-land) was established in 1974 for research into the effects of logging native beech forest (Nothofa-gus) and replanting with different non-indigenous species (Figure 7.6). The installation of hydrologi-cal measuring equipment and the fact that rain-fall and stormﬂow are frequently observed made it an ideal place for studying stormﬂow genera-tion mechanisms in depth. The knowledge gained from detailed hydrological process studies at Mai-mai have played a major part in shaping thinking on stormﬂow generation mechanisms.The Maimai catchment is characterised by short, steep slopes (approximately 300 m with angles of around 35°), covered in thick vegeta-tion, with incised channels and very small valley bottoms. Annual rainfall is approximately 2,600 mm with an average of 156 rain days a year, and stormﬂow makes up 65 per cent of the total streamﬂow (Rowe et al. 1994; Pearce et al. 1986).Mosley (1979, 1982) used Maimai to investi-gate the role of macropores as conduits for rapid movement of rainfall to the stream. Observations of macropore ﬂow rates using cut soil faces and dye tracers suggested that rainfall could travel down the short steep hillslopes at Maimai in less than 3 hours (i.e. within the time frame of a storm event). Subsequent chemical and isotopic analysis of streamﬂow, rainfall and water exiting the cut soil pit faces showed that the majority of measured streamﬂow was ‘old’ water, suggesting that rapid, extensive macropore ﬂow was not the main mecha-nism for stormﬂow generation (Pearce et al. 1986).McDonnell (1990) investigated this further, in particular looking at possible groundwater ridging (Sklash and Farvolden 1979) as a mecha-nism for large amounts of old water as saturated overland ﬂow. Although this could be observed at Maimai, the amount of water held near the stream prior to an event was not large enough to account for all of the old water, which suggested that another mechanism (e.g. piston ﬂow) might be working (McDonnell 1990).McGlynn et al. (2002) present a summary con-ceptual diagram of runoff mechanisms on Mai-mai hillslopes that combines many of the features described above (see Figure 7.7). In this model there is rapid inﬁltration of water through macropores to reach the bedrock. At this stage a form of piston ﬂow occurs as the saturated zone at the base of the soil mantle is conﬁned by the soil matrix above it. At the bedrock interface there may be a network of macro-pores or else the same situation of a conﬁned aqui-fer in that the soil matrix above has a much lower hydraulic conductivity. Water is then pushed out at the bottom due to the pressure from new water arriv-ing directly at the bedrock interface. There is also a mixing of the new water with old water sitting in bedrock hollows, creating a rapid movement of old water into the stream during storm events.

At the time of the photograph (1970s) ﬁve catchments had been logged and were about to be replanted with Pinus radiata.RUNOFF143How relevant are the Maimai stormflow generation studies?The studies that have taken place at Maimai have been extremely important in inﬂuencing hydro-logical thinking around the world. However, an argument can be made that the conditions at Mai-mai are far from generally applicable elsewhere. The main study catchment (M8) has short, steep slopes and is in an area of high, and frequent, rain-fall. The soils are extremely porous (inﬁltration rates in excess of 1,600 mm/hour have been mea-sured) and remain within 10 per cent of saturation for most of the year (Mosley 1979). These condi-tions are not common and it would be difﬁcult to generalise the concepts beyond Maimai. One of the really important concepts that Maimai has shown is that under conditions ideal for stormﬂow generation the mechanisms are still extremely complex and spatially variable. This is true wher-ever in the world the study is taking place.

(2002)Summary of storm runoff mechanismsThe mechanisms that lead to a storm hydrograph are extremely complex and still not fully under-stood. Although this would appear to be a major failing in a science that is concerned with the move-ment of water over and beneath the surface, it is also an acknowledgement of the extreme diversity found in nature. In general there is a reasonable understanding of possible storm runoff mechanisms but it is not possible to apply this universally. In some ﬁeld situations the role of throughﬂow and piston ﬂow are important, in others not; likewise for groundwater contributions, overland ﬂow and pipeﬂow. Figure 7.8 provides a conceptual over-view of the types of ﬂow processes in relation to the potential contribution to the overall hydrograph. Note that the boundaries are purposefully blurred. Clearly, rapid response mechanisms are respon-sible for the peak, and the slower are responsible for the recession, but speciﬁc local characteristics will determine the ‘hydrological signature’ of the particular catchment. The challenge for modern hydrology is to identify quickly the speciﬁc domi-nant mechanisms for a particular hillslope or catch-ment so that the understanding of the hydrological processes in that situation can be used to aid man-agement of the catchment.The processes of storm runoff generation described here are mostly observable at the hill-slope scale, and different processes will be occurring simultaneously throughout a catchment (Fig-ure 7.9). At the catchment scale (and particularly for large river basins) the timing of peak ﬂow (and consequently the shape of the storm hydrograph) is inﬂuenced more by the channel drainage network and the precipitation characteristics of a storm than by the mechanisms of runoff. This is a good exam-ple of the problem of scale described in Chapter 1. At the small hillslope scale storm runoff generation mechanisms are important, but they become con-siderably less so at the much larger catchment scale.Figure 7.8 Runoff generation processes in relation to the generated hydrograph.Horton overlandflowThrough flowSaturatedsoilSaturatedoverland flowWatertableGroundwaterflowStream flow

streambank and bed and is only detectable through repeated measurement of streamﬂow down a reach.Channel ﬂowOnce water reaches the stream it will ﬂow through a channel network to the main river. The controls over the rate of ﬂow of water in a channel are to do with the volume of water present, the gradient of the channel, and the resistance to ﬂow experienced at the channel bed. This relationship is described in uni-form ﬂow formulae such as the Chezy and Manning equations (see p. 173). The resistance to ﬂow is gov-erned by the character of the bed surface. Boulders and vegetation will create a large amount of friction, slowing the water down as it passes over the bed.BaseﬂowIn sharp contrast to the storm runoff debate, there is general consensus that the major source of baseﬂow is groundwater – and to a lesser extent throughﬂow. This is water that has inﬁltrated the soil surface and moved towards the saturated zone. Once in the saturated zone it moves downslope, often towards a stream. A stream or lake is often thought to occur where the regional water table intersects the sur-face, although this may not always be the case. In Chapter 5 the relationship between groundwater and streamﬂow has been explained (see Figure 5.5). However, in general it can be said that baseﬂow is provided by the slow seepage of water from ground-water into streams. This will not necessarily be vis-ible (e.g. springs) but can occur over a length of 
Figure 7.9 Runoff generation processes occurring throughout a catchment.Source: Reproduced from Charlton (2008), with permission146RUNOFFThroughﬂowMeasurement of throughﬂow is fraught with difﬁ-culty. The only way to measure it is with through-ﬂow troughs dug into the soil at the depths of interest in the soil proﬁle. For example, if one was measuring throughﬂow down a slope, a trench would need to be dug perpendicular to the ﬂow direction. Flow at various depths would need to be contained and separated for measurement. The problem with this is that in digging, the soil proﬁle is disturbed and consequently the ﬂow character-istics change. It is usual to insert troughs into a soil face that has been excavated and then reﬁll the hole. This may still overestimate throughﬂow as the reconstituted soil in front of the troughs may encourage ﬂow towards it as an area allowing rapid ﬂow. Subsurface ﬂow tracing has also been used – this involves adding a conservative tracer (i.e. some-thing that does not bind to the soil) to water to enable the ﬂow path to be detected. Tracers include sodium chloride and bromide but also ﬂuorescent dyes such as RhodamineWT (Shaw et al. 2011). These methods represent a very complex experi-mental setup (see Shaw et al. (2011) for a more complete description).FLOODSThe term ﬂood is difﬁcult to deﬁne except in the most general of terms. In a river a ﬂood is nor-mally considered to be an inundation of land adjacent to a river caused by a period of abnor-mally large discharge (Figure 7.10 and 7.11) or encroachment by the sea, but even this deﬁnition is fraught with inaccuracy. Flooding may occur from sources other than rivers (e.g. the sea and lakes), and ‘abnormal’ is difﬁcult to pin down, particu-larly within a timeframe. Floods come to our atten-tion through the amount of damage that they cause and for this reason they are often rated on a cost basis rather than on hydrological criteria. Hydro-logical and monetary assessments of ﬂooding often differ markedly because the economic valuation is highly dependent on location. If the area of land In many areas of the world, the channel network is highly variable in time and space. Small chan-nels may be ephemeral and in arid regions will frequently only ﬂow during ﬂood events. The resis-tance to ﬂow under these circumstances is compli-cated by the inﬁltration that will be occurring at the water front and bed surface. The ﬁrst ﬂush of water will inﬁltrate at a much higher rate as it ﬁlls the available pore space in the soil/rock at the bed surface. This will remove water from the stream and also slow the water front down as it creates a greater friction surface. Under a continual ﬂow regime the inﬁltration from the stream to ground will depend on the hydraulic gradient and the inﬁl-tration capacity.Measuring hillslope runoffThe measurement of runoff may be required to assess the relative contribution of different hill-slope runoff processes, i.e. throughﬂow, overland ﬂow, etc. There are no standard methods for the measurement of runoff processes; different research-ers use different techniques according to the ﬁeld conditions expected and personal preference.Overland ﬂowThe amount of water ﬂowing over the soil surface can be measured using collection troughs at the bottom of hillslopes or runoff plots. A runoff plot is an area of hillslope with deﬁnite upslope and side boundaries so that you can be sure all the over-land ﬂow is generated from within each plot. The upslope and side boundaries can be constructed by driving metal plates into the soil and leaving them protruding above the surface. All ﬂow is therefore contained and can be directed to either a tipping bucket type instrument or temporary ﬂume where it can be measured as a volume per unit time (see next chapter). It is normal to use several runoff plots to characterise overland ﬂow on a slope as it varies considerably in time and space. This spatial and temporal variation may be overcome with the use of a rainfall simulator.RUNOFF147inundated by a ﬂooding river is in an expensive region with large infrastructure then the cost will be considerably higher than, say, for agricultural land. Two examples of large-scale ﬂoods during the 1990s illustrate this point. In 1998 ﬂoods in China caused an estimated US$20 billion of damage with over 15 million people being displaced and 3,000 lives lost (Smith 2001). This ﬂood was on a similar scale to one that occurred in the same region dur-ing 1954. A much larger ﬂood (in a hydrological sense) in the Mississippi and Missouri rivers dur-ing 1993 resulted in a similar economic valuation of loss (US$15–20 billion) but only 48 lives were lost (USCE 1996). The ﬂood was the highest in the hydrological record and had an average recur-rence interval of between 100 and 500 years (USCE 1996). The difference in lives lost and relative eco-nomic loss (for size of ﬂood) is a reﬂection of the differing response to the ﬂood in two economically contrasting countries.As described in Chapter 2 for precipitation, ﬂooding is another example where the frequency–magnitude relationship is important. Small ﬂood events happen relatively frequently whereas the really large ﬂoods occur rarely but cause the most damage. The methods for interpreting riverﬂows that may be used for ﬂood assessment are discussed in Chapter 6. They provide some form of objec-tive ﬂood size assessment, but their value is highly dependent on the amount of data available.Floods are a frequently occurring event around the world, for example in June and July 2007 there were eleven large ﬂood events reported in the news media (see Table 7.3). These ﬂoods were caused by varying amounts of rainfall, and occurred in dif-ferent seasons of the year but all caused signiﬁcant damage and in many cases loss of lives. There are numerous reasons why a river will ﬂood and they almost always relate back to the processes found within the hydrological cycle. The main cause of river ﬂoods is when there is too much rainfall for the river to cope with. Other, more special causes of ﬂoods are individual events like dam bursts, jökulhlaups (ice-dam bursts) or snow melt (see pp. 78–81).Figure 7.10 A river in ﬂood. The excess water has spread across the ﬂoodplain outside the main river channel.

As described on p. 123, the amount of inﬁltration into a soil and subsequent storm runoff are highly dependent on the degree of saturation in the soil. Almost all major ﬂood events are heavily inﬂuenced by the amount of rainfall that has occurred prior to the actual ﬂood-causing rainfall.Inﬂuences on ﬂood sizeThe extent and size of the ﬂood can often be related to other contributing factors that increase the effect of high rainfall. Some of these factors are described here but all relate back to concepts introduced in earlier chapters detailing the processes found within the hydrological cycle. Flooding provides an excellent example of the importance of scale, introduced in Chapter 1. Many of the factors dis-cussed here have an inﬂuence at the small scale (e.g. hillslopes or small research catchments of less than 10 km2) but not at the larger overall river catch-ment scale. This section explores some of the factors compounding ﬂood magnitude and we consider RUNOFF149taking the overland ﬂow away from its source. This network of gutters and drains frequently leads directly to a river drainage system, delivering more ﬂood water in a faster time. Where extensive urban-isation of a catchment occurs, ﬂood frequency and magnitude increases. Cherkauer (1975) shows a massive increase in ﬂood magnitude for an urban catchment in Wisconsin, USA when compared to a similar rural catchment (see pp. 252–253). Urban-isation is another inﬂuence on ﬂooding that is most noticeable at the small scale. This is mostly because the actual percentage area covered by impermeable urban areas in a larger river catchment is still very small in relation to the amount of permeable non-modiﬁed surfaces.River channel alterationsGeomorphologists traditionally view a natural river channel as being in equilibrium with the river ﬂow-ing within it. This does not mean that a natural river channel never ﬂoods, but rather that the channel has adjusted in shape in response to the normal discharge expected to ﬂow through it. When the river channel is altered in some way it can have a detrimental effect on the ﬂood characteristics for the river. In particular, channelisation using rigid structures can increase ﬂood risk. Ironically, channelisation is often carried out to lessen ﬂood risk in a particular area. This is frequently achieved, but in doing so water is passed on downstream at a faster rate than normal, increas-ing the ﬂood risk further downstream. If there is a natural ﬂoodplain further downstream this may not be a problem, but if there is not, downstream ripar-ian zones will be at greater risk.Land drainageIt is common practice in many regions of the world to increase agricultural production through the drainage of ‘swamp’ areas. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries huge areas of the fen-lands of East Anglia in England were drained and now are highly productive cereal and horticultural areas. The drainage of these regions provides for DeforestationThe effect of trees on runoff has already been described, particularly with respect to water resources. There is also considerable evidence that a large vegetation cover, such as forest, decreases the severity of ﬂooding. There are several reasons for this. The ﬁrst has already been described, in that trees provide an intercepting layer for rainfall and therefore slow down the rate at which the water reaches the surface. This will lessen the amount of rainfall available for soil moisture and therefore the antecedent soil moisture may be lower under for-est than for an adjoining pasture (NB this is not always the case, it is dependent on the time of year). The second factor is that forests often have a high organic matter in the upper soil layers which, as any gardener will tell you, is able to absorb more water. Again, this lessens the amount of overland ﬂow, although it may increase the amount of through-ﬂow. Finally, the inﬁltration rates under forest soils are often higher, leading again to less saturation excess overland ﬂow.The removal of forests from a catchment area will increase the propensity for a river to ﬂood and also increase the severity of a ﬂood event. Conversely the planting of forests on a catchment area will decrease the frequency and magnitude of ﬂood events. Fahey and Jackson (1997) show that after conversion of native tussock grassland to exotic pine plantations a catchment in New Zealand showed a decrease in the mean ﬂood peaks of 55–65 per cent. Although data of this type look alarming they are almost always taken from measurements at the small research catchment scale. At the larger scale the inﬂuence of deforestation is much harder to detect (see Chapter 11).UrbanisationUrban areas have a greater extent of impervious sur-faces than in most natural landforms. Consequently the amount of inﬁltration excess (Hortonian) over-land ﬂow is high. In addition to this, urban areas are often designed to have a rapid drainage system, 150RUNOFFClimate changeIn recent years any ﬂooding event has led to a clamour of calls to explain the event in terms of climatic change. This is not easy to do as climate is naturally so vari-able. What can be said though is that river channels slowly adjust to changes in ﬂow regime which may in turn be inﬂuenced by changes in climate. Many studies have suggested that future climate change will involve greater extremes of weather (IPCC 2007), including more high-intensity rainfall events. This is likely to lead to an increase in ﬂooding, particularly while a channel adjusts to the differing ﬂow regime (if it is allowed to).rapid removal of any surplus water, i.e. not needed by plants. Drained land will be drier than might be expected naturally, and therefore less storm runoff might be assumed. This is true in small rainfall events but the rapid removal of water through sub-surface and surface drainage leads to ﬂood peaks in the river drainage system where normally the water would have been slower to leave the land surface. So, although the drainage of land leads to an overall drying out of the affected area it can also lead to increased ﬂooding through rapid drainage. Again, this is scale-related, as described further in Chapter 11.Case studyMOZAMBIQUE FLOODS OF 2000During the early months of 2000, world news was dominated by the catastrophic ﬂooding that occurred in southern Africa and Mozambique in particular. The most poignant image from this time was the rescuing of a young mother, Sophia Pedro, with her baby Rosita, born up a tree while they sought refuge from the ﬂood waters. The international media coverage of the devastating ﬂood damage and the rescue operation that fol-lowed has ensured that this ﬂood will be remem-bered for a long time to come. It has given people the world over a reminder that ﬂooding is a hydrological hazard capable of spreading devasta-tion on a huge scale.The ﬂoods of Mozambique were caused by four storms in succession from January through to March 2000. The ﬁrst 3 months of the year are the rainy season (or monsoon) for south-eastern Africa and it is usual for ﬂooding to occur, although not to the scale witnessed in 2000. The monsoon started early in southern Mozambique; the rain-fall in Maputo was 70 per cent above normal for October–November 1999. This meant that any heavy rainfall later in the rainy season would be more likely to cause a ﬂood.The ﬁrst ﬂood occurred during January 2000 when the Incomáti and Maputo rivers (see Fig-ure 7.12) both burst their banks, causing wide-spread disruption. The second ﬂood occurred in early February, as the waters started to recede, except that now Cyclone Connie brought record rainfall to southern Mozambique and northern South Africa. The Limpopo river was as high as ever recorded (the previous high was in 1977) and major communication lines were cut. The third ﬂood, 21 February until the end of February, occurred when Cyclone Eline moved inland giv-ing record rainfall in Zimbabwe and northern South Africa, causing record-breaking ﬂoods. The Limpopo was 3 m higher than any recorded ﬂood and for the ﬁrst time in recorded history the Limpopo and Incomáti rivers joined together in a huge inundation. The extent of the ﬂooding can be seen in the satellite images (see Figures 7.13 and 7.14). The fourth ﬂood was similar in size to the second and occurred following Cyclone Glória in early March (Christie and Hanlon, 2001).There is no doubt that the Mozambique ﬂoods were large and catastrophic. How large they are, in terms of return periods or average recurrence RUNOFF151
intervals (see Chapter 9) is difﬁcult to assess. The major difﬁculty is to do with paucity of stream-ﬂow records and problems with measuring ﬂows during ﬂood events. On the Incomáti river the ﬂow records go back to 1937, and this was the largest ﬂood recorded. For the Limpopo there is some data back to the 1890s, and again this was the largest recorded ﬂow event. On the Maputo river to the south the ﬂood levels were slightly lower than a 1984 event. The difﬁculties in mea-suring riverﬂow during large ﬂood events are well illustrated by the failure of many gauging stations to function properly, either through com-plete inundation or being washed away. Christie and Hanlon (2001) quote an estimate of the ﬂood on the Limpopo having a 100-year average recur-rence interval, although this is difﬁcult to verify as most gauges failed. Smithers et al. (2001) quote an unpublished report by Van Bladeren and Van der Spuy (2000) suggesting that upstream trib-utaries of the Incomáti river exceeded the 100-year return period. Smithers et al. (2001) provide Figure 7.12 Location of the Incomáti, Limpopo and Maputo rivers in southern Africa.Source: Image courtesy of G. Robert Brakenridge at the NASA-supported Dartmouth Flood Observatory

an analysis of the 1–7-day rainfall for the Sabie catchment (a tributary of the Incomáti) which shows that in places the 200-year return period was exceeded. (NB this is an analysis of rainfall records not riverﬂow.)The reasons for the ﬂooding were simple, as they are in most cases: there was too much rain-fall for the river systems to cope with the resultant stormﬂow. The river catchments were extremely wet (i.e. high antecedent soil moisture values) prior to the extreme rainfall, due to a prolonged and wet monsoon. One possible explanation for the severity of the rainfall is linked in with the ENSO (El Niño: Southern Oscillation) ocean–weather patterns in the Paciﬁc. Christie and Hanlon (2001) present evidence that during a La Niña event (extreme cold temperatures in the western Paciﬁc Ocean) it is common to see higher rainfall totals in Mozambique. However, this is not a strong relationship and certainly could not be used to make predictions. Figure 7.15 shows the monsoon rainfall at Maputo (averaged over two rainy seasons) and associated La Niña events. There may be some link here but it is not imme-diately obvious, particularly when you consider 1965–66 which had high rainfall despite it being

an El Niño event (often associated with drought in southern Africa).What was unusual about the 2000 ﬂoods was that the tropical Eline cyclone (called typhoons or hurricanes elsewhere) moved inland, taking extremely high rainfall to Zimbabwe and north-ern South Africa. This is not normal behaviour for this type of storm and in so doing it created large ﬂoods in the headwaters of rivers draining into Mozambique. Flood warnings were issued by Zimbabwe and South Africa but the poor state of communications in Mozambique (exacerbated by the previous ﬂoods cutting communication lines) meant that they were not available to warn people on the ground. In all, 700 people died as a result of the ﬂoods and 45,000 people were displaced. It is estimated that it will cost US$450 million to repair damage to the infrastructure in Mozam-bique (Christie and Hanlon 2001). This is not the total cost of the ﬂood, which is far higher when loss of income and loss of private property are included. These costs will never be fully known as in many lesser-developed countries the costs are borne by individuals without any form of insur-ance cover.In many ways there are no new lessons to learn from the Mozambique ﬂoods of 2000. It is well known that adequate warning systems are needed (but expensive) and that people should be restricted from living in ﬂood-prone areas; but this is difﬁcult to achieve in a poor country such as Mozambique. The cause of the ﬂood was a huge amount of rainfall and the severity was inﬂuenced by the antecedent wetness of the ground due to a very wet monsoon.Figure 7.15 Rainfall totals during the rainy season (smoothed with a 2-year average) at Maputo airport, with vertical bars indicating the strength of La Niña events (on a scale of three: strong, medium, weak).Sources: Rainfall data from Christie and Hanlon (2001); La Niña strength from NOAA
Case studyBRISBANE FLOODING IN 2010–11The case study above of ﬂooding in Mozam-bique in 2000, was largely driven by the La Niña weather system. In 2017, conditions were repeated, and another major ﬂood occurred in Mozambique, showing the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of this large-scale climatic phenomenon. Similarly, a strong La Niña event during the southern hemi-sphere summer of 2010–11 was a contributor to the high rainfall totals, mainly through extra warm sea surface temperatures off the Queensland coast. As a consequence, large ﬂoods occurred in southern Queensland, Australia during the sum-mer of 2010–11.Floods are often classiﬁed based on probability (e.g. the average recurrence interval), observed maxima (e.g. the largest ﬂows in a river since records began) or the adverse effects (e.g. number of people affected or the damage costs). On all three of these criteria, the Brisbane ﬂoods of early 2011 were very large events. The rainfall in the 154RUNOFFBrisbane River catchment had an annual exceed-ance probability of 1 in 150 but in parts of the catchment it exceeded 1 in 500 (Nathan 2012) (Figure 7.16).In Brisbane City although it was the seventh highest recording of river height since records began in 1840 and the highest since 1974, an analysis of water volumes suggests that it was nearly double the size of the 1974 ﬂood. In terms of adverse effects, 37 people were killed during the ﬂoods; 29,000 homes or businesses were inun-dated and it is estimated the cost of insurance and recovery work was $5 billion Australian dollars (approximately $3.9 billion US dollars).It is interesting to compare the size and impact of the 2011 and 1974 ﬂoods as it crosses between physical hydrology (i.e. hydrological processes) and water resource management, but ﬁrst it is necessary to give some geographic context to the ﬂoods. The ﬂoods are referred to as the Brisbane ﬂoods but they affected a much wider area of southern Queensland. The Brisbane River catch-ment is 13,570 km2 and although the majority of land is used for pastoral grazing and forestry it also includes the cities of Brisbane (2011 popula-tion of 1.98 million people) and Ipswich (200,000 people) in its lower reaches.The peak of the ﬂood in Brisbane City was on 13 January, 2011 but it was the culmination of extreme rainfall from late November 2010. Six large rainfall events during this time led to December 2010 being the wettest December

Although the primary purpose of both dams and the reservoirs behind them is to sup-ply potable water to Brisbane, Ipswich and other nearby towns, they also provide hydro-electric power, recreational opportunities and most par-ticularly for the Wivenhoe Dam, ﬂood mitiga-tion potential. The fact that the 2011 ﬂood gave a lower recorded river height in Brisbane despite being a much larger volume of water than the 1974 ﬂood is partly due to the ﬂood mitigation provided by the Wivenhoe dam. However, there is some controversy around this as many people blame the Wivenhoe Dam operation for exacer-bating the ﬂood event.The spatially averaged rainfall total for the Brisbane catchment for 10–12 January, 2011 was 286 mm; less than the 349 mm 3-day total for 25–27 January, 1974 (van den Honert and McAneney 2011). However, the inﬂows at gaug-ing stations above the Wivenhoe Dam were the highest on record (Nathan 2012), which suggests that the role of antecedent soil mois-ture was important in making for a larger ﬂood volume than in 1974. Data from Seqwater, the company operating the Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams, show that on 7 January, both dams were above full storage capacity and consequently they released extra water into the rivers. By 11 January they had enough storage available that they could release only 60 per cent of the inﬂows (i.e. 40 per cent of the inﬂow was stored) and subsequently it is estimated the ﬂood peak in Brisbane City was reduced by 2 m and a further 14,000 properties were saved from inundation (van den Honert and McAneney 2011).Flood mitigation is an important water resource function but it is often much easier in theory than practice. During a large ﬂood event such as the Brisbane Floods of 2011 the dam operator is balancing holding as much water back as possible while retaining storage poten-tial for predicted rainfall events. The accuracy of rainfall prediction becomes paramount despite rainfall being a notoriously difﬁcult process to predict precisely. The independent hydrolo-gist engaged by the Queensland Commission of Inquiry to investigate the role of Wivenhoe Dam operation concluded that the dam opera-tions had achieved the best possible ﬂood miti-gation effect.At the time of the Brisbane Floods there was intense media speculation on the causes of the ﬂooding with much speculation on the role of the Wivenhoe Dam operations. The vindication  provided by the Commission of Inquiry is grati-fying for the dam operators but it is worth con-sidering why the media, as reﬂectors of society, were so intense in their scrutiny. There are several factors in this. The ﬁrst is that the summer of 2010–11 was preceded by an extreme dry period, so much so that the year before there were serious  concerns that Brisbane would run out of potable water; therefore the prevailing narrative was of low water levels in the dams above Brisbane. A second point is that there had been no major ﬂoods since 1974 so that ﬂooding was not in the collective memory of many Brisbane residents.  In addition to that the Wivenhoe Dam had been built since 1974 which no doubt gave a sense of false security that ﬂooding was no longer an issue for Brisbane. A ﬁnal point is that our twenty-ﬁrst-century society likes to have an instant scapegoat for natural disasters like ﬂoods. Nathan (2012) uses the 2011 Brisbane ﬂoods to draw ‘lessons from large ﬂoods’. Amongst the lessons learned are the following: big rains cause big ﬂoods; com-municating risk is difﬁcult; and hydrologic com-plexity cannot be ignored. These lessons apply across the world and are worth water resource managers and hydrologists having pinned on their ofﬁce walls!"
7,"Being able to measure the volume of water ﬂowing down a stream in a set amount of time is a fun-damental task for any hydrologist. The techniques and research into the measurement of streamﬂow are referred to as hydrometry. Hydrometry is the area of hydrology that has probably seen the great-est changes in the past 10–15 years, driven by an integration of advanced electronic instrumentation into environmental science. However, the fun-damental principles of streamﬂow measurement remain the same. Streamﬂow measurement can be subdivided into two important subsections: instan-taneous and continuous techniques.INSTANTANEOUS STREAMFLOW MEASUREMENTVelocity–area methodStreamﬂow or discharge is a volume of water per unit of time. The standard units for measurement of discharge are m3/s (cubic metres per second or cumecs). If we rewrite the units of discharge we can think of them as a water velocity (m/s) passing through a cross-sectional area (m2). Therefore:m3/s = m/s × m2 (8.1)LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039A knowledge of the techniques and instruments used for measuring streamﬂow directly. /H17039An understanding of the challenges involved in maintaining an accurate ﬂow record. /H17039A knowledge of techniques used to estimate streamﬂow. /H17039How to construct a stage vs discharge relationship (a rating curve).8MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW158MEASURING CHANNEL FLOWMaking a streamﬂow measurementThere is an international standard for the measure-ment of discharge in streams, rivers and other open channels (ISO 748:2007). This ISO standard sets out precise details for measurements to meet the highest standard; the methods described in this book are based on this standard but give broader guidelines.The ﬁrst consideration when making a stream-ﬂow measurement is to select a good reach of the stream. The channel should be straight and uniform in bed and slope down the reach (i.e. it doesn’t move from a pool to a rifﬂe, or vice versa, in the reach). Areas with reverse ﬂow or back waters should be avoided and the cross section to be measured should be clear of overhanging trees reaching the water or other obstacles such as large rocks.Once a suitable reach has been found, a tape measure or ‘tag line’ should be strung across the stream to measure width and establish position of verticals in the cross section. The number of verticals required in the cross-sectional areas that are used in a discharge measurement depend upon the width and smoothness of the stream bed. If the bed is particularly rough it is necessary to use more cross-sectional areas so that the estimates are as close to reality as possible (note the discrepancy between the dashed and solid lines in Figure 8.1). The ISO standard for number of verticals is set out in Table 8.1. Note for channels greater than 5 m in width you may have to do a trial discharge measurement and check whether you have enough verticals to fulﬁl the criteria of between 5–10 per cent of total ﬂow.The measurement of stream velocity is done using a current meter. The development of differ-ent types of current meters has been a huge advance in hydrometry in the past 20 years and different types of ﬂow meters are described in the following section.In the velocity–area method it is necessary to assume that the velocity measurement is rep-resentative of all the velocities throughout the The velocity–area method measures the stream velocity (m/s) and the stream cross-sectional area (m2) and then multiplies the two together. In prac-tice this is carried out by dividing the stream into small sections and measuring the velocity of ﬂow going through each cross-sectional area and apply-ing Equation 8.2.Qvavavaii=++1122... (8.2)Where Q is the streamﬂow or discharge (m3/s), v is the velocity measured in each trapezoidal cross-sectional area (see Figure 8.1), and a is the area of the trapezoid (usually estimated as the average of two depths divided by the width between).

MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW159up the pole so that the depth of the stream can be easily read. The best form of wading rod is called a top setting rod which, as well as having the depth adjustment for the meter above the water, also has an easy calculator for 60 per cent of the total depth. Although this may not be important on a lovely warm day it is very important on a cold winter’s day when you do not want to immerse your hands in water for any longer than you have to. It is also surprising how difﬁcult it is to make a mental cal-culation of 60 per cent of the total depth when you are very cold – hence the necessity of a good wad-ing rod!When taking the velocity measurement it is important that the current meter points directly into the stream ﬂow. If a good reach of river has been chosen then the direction of ﬂow should be at right angles to the tape strung across the stream to measure width. The International Standard sets out that each velocity measurement must be for a minimum of 30 seconds; the actual time taken per reading is instrument dependent and will be set out in the instructions for use.Where there is no current meter available it may be possible to make a very rough estimate of stream velocity using a ﬂoat in the stream and measur-ing the time it takes to cover a measured distance. When using this method, allowance must be made for the fact that the ﬂoat is travelling on the sur-face of the stream at a faster rate than water closer to the stream bed and that the velocity will not be uniform across the whole proﬁle. If the faster surface velocity is ignored then the estimated velocity will be higher than the overall average and streamﬂow over-estimated. Somewhat surprisingly given the approximate nature of this measurement technique, the International Standard does set out procedures for using ﬂoats in velocity measure-ment. ISO 748:2007 suggests that surface velocity should be multiplied by somewhere between 0.84 and 0.9 to give the actual average velocity through the proﬁle. The higher values are for when there is a smooth stream bed and lower for rough beds (i.e. many boulders).cross-sectional area. When using a mechanical cur-rent meter it is not normally possible to take mul-tiple measurements so an allowance has to be made for the fact that the water travels faster along the surface than nearer the stream bed. This difference in velocity is due to friction exerted on the water as it passes over the stream bed, slowing it down. The International Standard sets out methods for one, two, three, ﬁve and six depth proﬁles but the most common is to use one or two depths. For a single sample of velocity the current meter should be 60 per cent of the stream depth – that is, in a stream that is 1 m deep the sampling point should be 0.6 m below the surface or 0.4 m above the bed. In a deep river it is good practice to take two (or more) measurements. If using the two-depth sample method then one measurement should be at 20 per cent and the other at 80 per cent of total depth and two velocities are averaged.When discharge is measured with a waded cross section, the current meter (whether mechanical, electromagnetic or ADCP) is attached to a graded metal pole, called a wading rod. Although rela-tively simple in design, a good wading rod is an essential tool for any ﬁeld hydrologist. At the bot-tom of a rod is the baseplate which rests ﬁrmly on the stream bed. The rod has graduated markings Table 8.1 ISO standard guidance on number of verticals required for accurate assessment of stream dischargeChannel widthNumber of verticalsLess than 0.5 m5–60.5 m to 1.0 m6–71.0 m to 3.0 m7–123.0 to 5.0 m13–16Greater than 5.0 mEnough so that the discharge in each vertical is between 5 and 10% of the totalNote: The number of verticals does not include the two zero depth measurements at either side of the cross section.Source: ISO 748:2007160MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW
down through the river proﬁle rather than be swept downstream or stay near the surface. When gauging from a bridge the measurement needs to be taken enough upstream from the bridge so that the ﬂow around bridge supports does not interfere with the velocity measurement. This normally means some form of crane rig that suspends the current meter several metres upstream from the bridge. Needless to say, whether from a bridge or a cableway, ﬂood gauging is a very dangerous task as the river veloci-ties are likely to be high and ﬂood debris can catch on the current meter, dragging it downstream.The velocity–area method is an effective tech-nique for measuring streamﬂow, but its reliabil-ity is heavily dependent on the sampling strategy. The technique is also less reliable in small, turbid streams with a rough bed (e.g. mountain streams). Under these circumstances other streamﬂow estima-tion techniques such as dilution gauging may be more applicable (see streamﬂow estimation section).Types of current meterMechanical current metersA mechanical ﬂow meter is a form of propeller inserted into the stream which records the number Figure 8.2 shows the measurement of streamﬂow in a river by wading across with the mechanical current meter held in front and pointing upstream. This is non-continuous; i.e. the person stops at points across the proﬁle and measures the velocity for a period of time, usually 30 seconds or more. They then work their way across the stream to create the type of proﬁle shown in Figure 8.1. In a much larger river, or a river in ﬂood, it is not possible to wade across so the velocity measurements have to be taken in another way. On a very large river, like the Mississippi, this would normally be done from a boat that slowly crosses the river with a current meter attached to the front. The boat needs to stop at set locations and remain stationary (i.e. drive against the current) while the velocity measure-ment is taken – a very skilful task. In large rivers it is normal to take velocities at a series of depths to gain an average. For rivers in ﬂood it is frequently unsafe to operate a boat (e.g. Figure 8.3) so veloc-ity measurements are taken from a nearby bridge or from a cage suspended above the river on a cableway (see Figure 8.4). For very large ﬂows (e.g. during a ﬂood) the propeller on the current meter needs to be very large and weighted heavily to ensure it sinks 
Figure 8.3 A river in heavy ﬂood. Measuring the ﬂow here could be done from the nearby bridge but it is a very dangerous job and the velocities will be inﬂuenced by the turbulent nature of the river and increased ﬂow velocities around the bridge supports.

The current meter is suspended from the cable at set points across the river and a velocity proﬁle is measured.MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW161the discharge down the River Thames in London as it ﬂowed under Waterloo Bridge. The biggest prob-lem Faraday faced was that he could not measure the voltage accurately enough, something that has now been overcome.Electromagnetic current meters have an advan-tage over mechanical meters in that they don’t have propellers interfering with ﬂow and don’t easily get fouled up with debris. They are expensive pieces of equipment and generally have not had as high an uptake as ADCP technology.Ultrasonic ﬂow measurementUltrasonic ﬂow measurement relies on precise measurement of the difference in transit time of ultrasonic pulses propagating with and against ﬂow direction. The most common form of ultrasonic ﬂow measurement uses Acoustic Doppler Cur-rent Proﬁling (ADCP , also called Acoustic Dop-pler  Velocimetry – ADV). The growth of ADCP technology has led to huge advances in hydrometry over the past 20 years. ADCP allows us to measure stream velocity in an integrated manner across a river; i.e. it measures velocity at a series of depths in the proﬁle all at once rather than at a single point like a mechanical current meter. To under-stand ADCP you need to have a basic understand-ing of the Doppler Effect; named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler who ﬁrst proposed the idea in 1842. A simple analogy to demonstrate the Doppler Effect is if you stand on the side of a road while a car drives past you. As the car goes past you the engine noise appears to change from a higher to a lower sound while for the driver the engine noise stays the same. As the car approaches, each sound wave is emitted from a position closer to you than the previous wave. Therefore each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. The opposite happens as the car moves away from you; effectively lengthening the sound wave. For the car driver it always sounds the same because the sound waves are always com-ing from the same distance away. To complicate things further, the Doppler Effect will sound more of propeller revolutions with time as the water ﬂows in and around the meter. The number of revolutions in a set time is easily converted into stream velocity using the calibration equation supplied with the current meter. There are many different sizes and types of mechanical current meters, all of which are designed for different stream sizes and veloci-ties. It is important that the correct meter is used in the right conditions otherwise inaccurate veloci-ties will be measured. Large propellers are for use in large swift rivers (or small rivers in ﬂood) but will be inappropriate for small rivers at low ﬂow as the propellers will be too big for stream depth. In a vice versa form small propellers are not able to rotate quickly enough in high velocity streams and underestimate the stream velocity.Up until around the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst cen-tury, stream velocity was most commonly measured with mechanical current meters. A good mechani-cal current meter is a robust and reliable tool for measuring instantaneous streamﬂow but it is grad-ually being replaced by more advanced technology using Electromagnetic or Acoustic Doppler Cur-rent Proﬁling (ADCP) techniques.Electromagnetic current metersElectromagentic current meters are widely used for measuring the velocity of ﬂuids in pipes but a variation of the technology can be used to mea-sure water velocity in an open channel. The funda-mental theory underpinning electromagnetic ﬂow meters is that of electromagentic induction; ﬁrst discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. Faraday’s Law describes how a voltage will be induced in a conductor moving through a magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of streamﬂow measurement the conductor is the body of water ﬂowing past a magenetic ﬁeld between two magnets. When the length of con-ductor (i.e length of water measured over) and the strength of magnetic ﬁeld remain ﬁxed the magni-tude of the induced voltage is directly proportional to the velocity of the water. One of the earliest elec-tromagentic ﬂow meters was built by Faraday him-self in 1832 when he unsucessfully tried to measure 162MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW
mechanical meter. In general, the Flow Tracker can be used in a wider range of conditions (e.g. shal-lower water and lower velocity) than a mechanical meter.There are also larger ADCP instruments that can be mounted on boats to provide a velocity pro-ﬁle across a stream (see Figure 8.6). Recent models can be mounted on a remote controlled small boat that can be driven across the river while the user stands on the bank; thus improving the health and safety for the ﬁeld hydrologist. For a boat mounted ADCP, sound waves reﬂecting off the river bottom can be used to deﬁne the depth proﬁle plus the velocity (i.e. both speed and direction) of the boat itself; a feature referred to as ‘bottom tracking’. Using this feature, a full proﬁle of velocity and depth can be derived which automatically inte-grates the velocity and area in a single measure-ment of ﬂow.A problem can arise with bottom tracking when the bed of the river is moving; for instance dur-ing a ﬂood event the sand and gravel on a river bed can be moving with the faster velocity of the river. In this case the bottom tracking doesn’t work and a Geographic Positioning System (GPS) unit is required on the ADCP to keep track of position across the river.pronounced the faster the car is going and will also depend on the wind speed. The Doppler Effect may therefore result from motion of the source (the car), motion of the observer (you), or motion of the medium (air).In order to measure river velocity, the Doppler Effect is utilised by an instrument emitting an ultrasonic acoustic burst, which then measures the change in wavelengths (frequency) of reﬂections from particles moving with the ﬂow. The faster the movement of particles in the stream, the greater is the distortion in wavelength that the ADCP sensor detects. An ADCP instrument can measure in real time a complete velocity proﬁle for a stream con-taining particles in suspension such as sediment or air bubbles. Sound travels at approximately 1,500 m/s in water (dependent on water purity and depth) so the instrumentation used in this type of ﬂow gauging needs to be extremely precise and be able to measure in nanoseconds. It is only with advances in electronics since the 1990s that a portable ﬁeld instrument has been able to be developed; i.e. sending high frequency ultrasonic waves and then being able to measure the frequency of returning waves requires sensors that weren’t available 30–40 years ago and a computing power that can now be found in simple silicon chips. Early ADCP instru-ments required a signiﬁcant amount of suspended sediment or air bubbles in the water to operate well; a problem for very clear streams. More mod-ern instruments are less prone to this as they can detect very small air bubbles that exist in almost all streams.There are many different types of ADCP instru-ments all of use in different streams and rivers. There is a small pole-mounted ADCP such as the SonTek Flow Tracker (see Figure 8.5) that is used in the same way as a mechanical current meter with the user wading across a stream and taking a veloc-ity proﬁle at points across the stream. An advan-tage of the Flow-Tracker type instrument over a mechanical current meter is that velocity is mea-sured in a three dimensional cone in front of the instrument, therefore providing an average veloc-ity over a greater area than the single point from a 
Figure 8.5 Portable ADCP (SonTek Flow Tracker) being used to measure a small stream.MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW163CONTINUOUS STREAMFLOW MEASUREMENTThe methods of instantaneous streamﬂow measure-ment described above only allow a single measure-ment to be taken at a location. Although this can be repeated at a future date it requires a continu-ous measurement technique to give the data for a hydrograph. There are three different techniques that can be used for this: stage–discharge relation-ships, ﬂumes and weirs, and ultrasonic ﬂow gaug-ing. There are two International Standards that cover continuous stream ﬂow measurement (ISO 1100–1 and 1100–2).Stage vs discharge relationshipRiver stage is another term for the water level or height. Where multiple discharge measurements have been taken (i.e. repeat measurements using velocity–area method) it is possible to draw a rela-tionship between river stage and discharge: the so-called rating curve. An example of a rating curve is shown in Figure 8.8. This has the advantage of allowing continuous measurement of river stage (a relatively simple task) that can then be equated to the actual discharge. The stage–discharge relation-ship is derived through a series of velocity–area measurements at a particular site while at the same

164MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW
An accurate stage vs discharge relationship is dependent on frequent and accurate measurement of river discharge, and a static river bed proﬁle. If the river bed proﬁle changes, the stage vs discharge relationship (rating curve) will change and the his-toric relationship will no longer be valid. The three most common reasons for a change in bed proﬁle are the bed of a river being scoured out during a ﬂood event; the bed being raised up from sediment deposition during a ﬂood event; or aquatic plants growing in a stream causing the velocity to slow down and the water level to rise (see Case Study). In a gravel-bed river (e.g. Figure 8.10), bed movement is a constant issue which may mean adjustments to the rating curve after every fresh or ﬂood. In Fig-ure 8.12 the record of stage seems to have shifted upwards following the large ﬂood in the middle of the record. Although it is possible that the ﬂow remained higher following the ﬂood, the fact that it never drops to anywhere near the pre-ﬂood stage make it more likely the bed has aggraded (built up in level).

As can be seen in Figure 8.8, the rating curve is non-linear, a reﬂection of the river bank proﬁle. When the river is low it is conﬁned to a small area so that a small change in discharge (i.e. increased ﬂow) will cause a signiﬁcant rise in stage height. As the river ﬁlls up between banks it takes a greater volume of water to cause the same change in stage height than at low levels.Figure 8.10 A hydrometric station with the stilling well beside a gravel bed river.

If a new rating curve wasn’t used then the ﬂow would have been over-estimated following Case studyMACROPHYTE GROWTH AFFECTING A RATING CURVEThe Halswell River is a small spring-fed river in the South Island of New Zealand (Figure 8.13). The river shows all the classic characteristics of a groundwater fed system: it continues ﬂowing steadily through the summer and does not have a huge range of ﬂows – it doesn’t get very low, nor does it get very high except in exception-ally large storm events. Because of the catch-ment intensive agricultural land use the water is nutrient rich; this combined with a lack of frequent ﬂushing ﬂows makes the river an ideal growing place for aquatic plants (macrophytes). As the plants grow they choke the stream and lessen the cross sectional area. This means that either the velocity has to increase or the water level rises to accommodate the smaller cross sec-tional area.In a low gradient river like the Halswell, the choking of the stream can happen over a long dis-tance and it is not feasible to continuously clear the stream of aquatic plants. During the Southern Hemisphere late summer of February to March 2013 there was a continuous rise in the water level which at ﬁrst consideration would suggest an increase in ﬂow (see the rise on the solid line in Figure 8.14). However, regular gauging of the stream showed that each time the velocity had decreased, the ﬂow had actually decreased (see Figure 8.14). The macrophytes were changing the cross sectional area as they grew. To main-tain an accurate ﬂow record, it was necessary to continually adjust the rating curve. The difﬁculty with this is that it is a gradual adjustment as the plants grow; as opposed to a change from a dis-crete event like a ﬂood. As a result the continuous measurement of low ﬂow in nutrient-rich, spring-fed streams like the Halswell River is a challenge for ﬁeld hydrologists.

Case studyHOW TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN RATING CURVESThe need to have good accurate rating curves underpins the work of any ﬁeld hydrologist. Without them, ﬂow data are unreliable and any further statistical analysis of streamﬂow data will be of dubious quality. However, there are no hard and fast rules for rating curve construction and One of the difﬁculties with the stage– discharge relationship is that the requirement of frequent measurements of river discharge lead to many mea-surements taken during periods of low and medium ﬂow but very few during ﬂood events. This is for the double reason that: ﬂoods are infrequent and unlikely to be measured under a regular monitoring programme; and the danger of streamﬂow gauging during a ﬂood event. The lack of data at the extreme end of the stage vs discharge curve may lead to dif-ﬁculties in interpreting data during peak ﬂows. The error involved in estimating peak discharge from a measured stage vs discharge relationship will be much higher at the high ﬂow end of the curve. However once the top of a rating curve is estab-lished (i.e. ﬂow measurement carried out during a peak ﬂood) that point is less likely to be affected by bed changes as the depth will be great and a small change from bed scoring or deposition will cause less of an effect than when at low ﬂow.When interpreting data derived from the stage–discharge relationship it is important that the hydrol-ogist bears in mind that it is stage height that is being measured continuously and from this stream discharge is estimated via a rating curve relationship (i.e. it is not a direct measurement of stream discharge).168MEASURING CHANNEL FLOWit can be viewed as an art as much as science. An experienced ﬁeld hydrologist will get ‘the feel’ for how a rating curve should look and know very quickly whether it needs changing. For the less experienced there are many tips that will be helpful.A curious feature of rating curves is that by tradition discharge is on the x-axis (horizontal) with stage on the vertical y-axis when they should really be the other way around. In statistics con-vention has it that the independent variable is on the x-axis with the predicted or dependent vari-able on the y-axis. In a rating curve we are predict-ing discharge (dependent) from the stage height (independent); so by mathematical convention they should really be the other way around.The absolute basics for constructing a rating curve is to connect a series of ﬂow measurements (i.e. gaugings) with concurrent measurements of river stage (height). Flow is measured with a current meter using the velocity-area method described elsewhere in this chapter and stage is measured from a manual staff gauge at the ﬂow recorder. To construct a rating curve from scratch you will be required to have ﬂow measurements at a range of ﬂows (low and high). It will nor-mally take several months of ﬂow gaugings at a site before there are enough gaugings to construct the rating curve. Even then it is highly unlikely that there will be gaugings across the full range of ﬂows (see Figure 8.15).Measured ﬂows are plotted showing error bars (normally between 5–10 per cent depending on measurement method and ﬂow volumes) whereas the stage measurement is normally accurate enough to not require an error bar to be drawn.The ‘art’ of drawing a rating curve now comes in. Most hydrological computer programmes offer interpolation techniques for joining between gaugings but there will always be some interpre-tation in how to smooth between points. The most important point to note is that for all riv-ers in non-rectangular cross sections the rating curve will be non-linear. This is because as the

MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW169river level rises the width increases (i.e. the river spreads out) and the cross sectional area changes in a non-linear fashion. The exact shape of the non-linear curve is dependent on the shape of the river channel. As can be seen in Figure 8.15 the curve will not normally go exactly through each gauging point but you would expect it to be within gauging error. If this is not the case then the gauging needs careful checking and you may need to reconsider whether the bed level has stayed static between gaugings.A second important point is that ratings curves should be smooth, not having erratic dips and highs to accommodate gaugings. With time and regular gaugings at a site more points can be added to the top and bottom of the curve, thus getting a better idea of overall shape.The effort required to maintain a rating curve is dependent on how stable the site is. For a well controlled site with a stable bed you would not expect the rating curve to change except in extreme ﬂood events. For gravel-bed rivers the changes can be frequent and it is a challenging job to keep accurate ﬂow records. When gaugings are plotted with error bars and these do not intersect the rating curve it is time to change the rating curve (see example in Figure 8.16). Although you can do this on the basis of one gauging it is nor-mal (and wise) to have several gaugings so that the new shape can be established. If the rating curve is at a long-established site then the ﬁrst thing to do is retrieve previous rating curves and see if any of these ﬁt the gaugings. You should do this before starting to draw a new curve as rivers frequently re-establish old channel forms.At an unstable site, generally you will see more change at the lower end of the rating curve than at the higher end. This is because bed degrada-tion and aggradation has a much larger effect on low ﬂows than on higher ﬂows where the volume of water is so large. So generally different rating curves tend to converge on the same, or similar

In this case at higher ﬂows the current rating curve (dashed line) underpredicting the ﬂow, suggesting the river-bed has eroded (bed degradation).170MEASURING CHANNEL FLOWpoints at the top of the curve but will have differ-ent points at the lower end.The points at the top of a rating curve are nor-mally the hardest to obtain because ﬂoods occur infrequently and they are difﬁcult to measure (both from a technical and a health and safety perspective). However, it is often those ﬂoods that are the most important to obtain measure-ments for as the discharge numbers become vital for ﬂood frequency analysis. The infrequent nature of ﬂoods means that sometimes the rating curve cannot be fully drawn for several years after a new monitoring station has been established. When the top of a curve has ﬁnally been drawn it may mean altering ﬂow records for several years previously with the new stage–discharge relationship.The ﬁnal part of applying a rating curve change is to decide when it applies from so that the ﬂow record can be adjusted. For a ﬂood event the rating change is normally attributed to the high point of the hydrograph (i.e. peak discharge) although in reality it is often smoothed over several hours to avoid a step change in ﬂow. For aquatic weed growth the change may have to be smoothed over several days or weeks.Measuring stage heightThe measurement of stage has traditionally been done using a ﬂoat and counterweight within a still-ing well (see Figure 8.9). A ﬂoat on the surface of the water within the stilling well moves up and down with the height of the river with a wire con-nected to the ﬂoat going over a pulley at the top of the stilling well and being attached to a coun-terweight. Originally the pulley was connected through a small gearing mechanism to a pen mark-ing a rotating chart so that the stage height was continuously recorded (until the chart or pen ran out!). Nowadays an electronic encoder translates the position of the pulley into a stage height that is recorded electronically in a logging device.A stilling well with a good ﬂoat and counter-weight system is the gold standard for measuring stage. The stilling well is often combined with a logger and telemetry system (for sending the infor-mation from the ﬁeld back to an ofﬁce via radio or telephone signal) sitting on top of the well (see Figure 8.10). However, river banks can be a hostile environment and there is a ﬁnancial vulnerability in having a lot of expensive equipment sitting in a position where they could be washed away during a ﬂood. For this reason other, less accurate techniques can be used for measuring stage height. Three of the most common are: a gas bubbler, a pressure transducer, or a capacitance probe.A gas bubbler is a small tube containing air that can be run down a river bank so that the end of the gas line is sitting on the bottom of the river. Air is forced slowly down the gas line and a measurement taken of the force required for a bubble of air to leave the end of the line. The deeper the water the harder it is to force the air bubble out of the gas line which the measuring device records. The gas bub-bler and pressure sensing device can be a long way away from the river itself (e.g. 20–50 m up a bank) and well away from the destructive power of a ﬂood.A pressure transducer is rather like a barometer; it has a sensor in the end that sits at the bottom of a river (or lake, or groundwater well) and measures the pressure of water above it. The deeper the water the greater the pressure recorded. This pressure is translated into an electronic signal which is trans-mitted via a wire to the logging device which again may be well away from the river bank. A complica-tion of using pressure transducers is that there is the pressure of water above the sensor but there is also atmospheric pressure which varies with the weather. Some pressure transducers require a coin-cident measurement of atmospheric pressure with an adjustment to be made later but there are now self-contained pressure transducers that automati-cally adjust for atmospheric pressure.Capacitance probes measure the depth of water by measuring how easily electricity is transmitted MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW171Once the velocity and cross-sectional area are kept ﬁxed, the rating curve can be derived through a mixture of experiment and hydraulic theory. These relationships are normally power equations dependent on the shape of cross-sectional area used in the ﬂume or weir. There is an international stan-dard for manufacture and maintenance of weirs (ISO 1438) that set out theoretical ratings curves for different types of structures. The general for-mula for a V notch weir is shown in Equation 8.3.QgCh=⋅⋅⋅⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⋅0532225.tan.θ (8.3)Where Q is discharge (m3/s); g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2); C is coefﬁcient of dis-charge (see Figure 8.17); θ is the angle of V-notch (°); h is the height of water or stage (m). The coef-ﬁcient of discharge can be estimated from Fig-ure 8.17 for a certain angle of V-notch. For a 90° V-notch the coefﬁcient of discharge is 0.578 and the rating equation becomes:Qh=1 36625.. (8.4)There is a similar type of equation for rectangular weirs, based on the width of the rectangular exit and another version of the coefﬁcient of discharge relationship.The shape of cross-sectional area is an important consideration in the design of ﬂumes and weirs. The shape of permanent structure that the river ﬂows through is determined by the ﬂow regime of the river and the requirements for the stream-ﬂow data. A common shape used is based on the V-structure (see Figure 8.18). The reason for this is that when river levels are low, a small change in river ﬂow will correspond to a signiﬁcant change in stage (measured in the stilling well). This sen-sitivity to low ﬂows makes data from this type of ﬂume or weir particularly suitable for studying low ﬂow hydrology. It is important that under high ﬂow conditions the river does not overtop the ﬂume or weir structure. The V shape is con-venient for this also because as discharge increases between two sensors. The more (i.e. deeper) water present, the easier for the electrical current to be transmitted. This sounds simple enough and there are capacitance probes available that measure up to 10 m in depth. Care needs to be taken in interpret-ing the results from rivers as the ability to transmit electricity is also affected by the water chemistry. If this changes through a pollution incident or from differing ﬂow sources during a ﬂood then the capac-itance probe may have a different calibration curve than for less saline water.Flumes and weirsFlumes and weirs utilise the stage–discharge rela-tionship described above but go a step further towards providing a continuous record of river discharge. If we think of stream discharge as con-sisting of a river velocity ﬂowing through a cross-sectional area (as in the velocity proﬁle method) then it is possible to isolate both of these terms separately. This is what ﬂumes and weirs, or stream gauging structures, attempt to do.The ﬁrst part to isolate is the stream velocity. The way to do this is to slow a stream down (or, in some rare cases, speed a stream up) so that it ﬂows with constant velocity through a known cross- sectional area. The critical point is that in design-ing a ﬂume or weir the river ﬂows at the same velocity (or at least a known velocity) through the gauging structure irrespective of how high the river level is. Although this seems counter-intuitive (riv-ers normally ﬂow faster during ﬂood events) it is achievable if there is an area prior to the gauging structure that slows the river down: a stilling pond.The second part of using a gauging structure is to isolate a cross-sectional area. To achieve this, a rigid structure is imposed upon the stream so that it always ﬂows through a known cross- sectional area. In this way a simple measure of stream height through the gauging structure will give the cross-sectional area. Stream height is nor-mally derived through a stilling well, as described in Figure 8.9, except in this case there is a regular cross-sectional area.172MEASURING CHANNEL FLOW
as mountain streams. To overcome this difﬁculty there is a design of trapezoidal ﬂume that speeds the stream up rather than slows it down (see Fig-ure 8.19). The stream is forced to go down a steep section immediately prior to the gauging structure. In this way any sediment is ﬂushed out of the weir, removing the need for regular dredging. This is really only possible for small streams as the power of large rivers at high velocities would place enor-mous strains on the gauging structure.The difference between ﬂumes and weirsAlthough flumes and weirs perform the same  function – measuring stream discharge in a continu-ous fashion – they are not the same. In a weir the water is forced to drop over a structure (the weir – Figure 8.18) in the fashion of a small waterfall. In a ﬂume (Figure 8.19) the water passes through the structure without having a waterfall at the end.Continuous ﬂow gaugingThe ADCP or ultrasonic ﬂow gauging described earlier also has some capability to provide con-tinuous ﬂow measurement. Sideways, or upwards looking ADCP instruments mounted on a ﬁxed structure beside a river will provide a continuous the cross-sectional area ﬂowed through increases in a non-linear fashion. The angle of the V-notch will vary depending on the size of stream being mea-sured and the sensitivity required (90° and 120° V-notch weirs are both commonly used).One of the difﬁculties in maintaining gauging structures is that by slowing the river down in a stilling pond any sediment being carried by the water may be deposited (see Hjulstrom curve in Chapter 10), which with time will ﬁll the still-ing pond and lessen its usefulness. Because of this the stilling pond needs to be dredged regularly, particularly in a high energy environment such Figure 8.17 Coefﬁcient of discharge for V-notch weirs (ISO 1438).0.570.5750.580.5850.590.5950.6

With time these have developed into models simulating all the processes in the hydrological cycle so that far more than just streamﬂow can be estimated. How-ever, it is often streamﬂow that is seen as the end-product of a model, a reﬂection of the importance streamﬂow has as a hydrological parameter. These models are described in Chapter 9; this section con-centrates on direct estimates of streamﬂow.Physical or geomorphological estimation techniquesThe geomorphological approach to river systems uti-lises the idea that the river channel is in equilibrium with the ﬂow regime. This suggests that measures of the channel (e.g. depth/width ratio, wetted perim-eter, height to bankfull discharge) can be used to estimate the streamﬂows in both a historical and con-temporary sense. Wharton (1995) provides a review of these different techniques. This is not a method that can be used to estimate the discharge in a river at one particular time, but it can be used to estimate parameters such as the mean annual ﬂood. Important parameters to consider are the stream diameter, wet-ted perimeter and average depth. This is particularly for the area of channel that ﬁlls up during a small ﬂooding event: so-called bankfull discharge.It is possible to estimate the average velocity of a river stretch using a kinematic wave equation such as Manning’s (Equation 8.5).vkRsn=⋅⋅23/ (8.5)Where v is velocity (m/s); k is a constant depend-ing on which units of measurement are being used (1 for SI units, 1.49 for Imperial); R is the hydrau-lic radius (m); s is the slope (m/m); and n is the Manning roughness coefﬁcient. Hydraulic radius is the cross-sectional area of a river (m2) divided by the wetted perimeter (m). In very wide channels measurement of velocity passing the point. The cross-sectional area of the stream is also being collected but this is less reliable. In a ﬁxed chan-nel like under a bridge or an urban channel the ADCP may be able to measure depth to the bot-tom of the channel and the opposite side. However, for a normal river channel where the river spreads out extensively during ﬂoods it is more difﬁcult to get an accurate measurement of cross sectional area. Probably the greatest potential for continuous ultrasonic ﬂow gauging is in a channel affected by weed growth (see Case Study) where the velocity is being affected by a constricted channel area.Figure 8.19 A trapezoidal ﬂume. The stream passes through the ﬂume and the water level at the base of the ﬂume is recorded continuously.
174MEASURING CHANNEL FLOWof tracer used is dependent on the equipment avail-able; the main point is that it must be detectable in solution and non-harmful to the aquatic ﬂora and fauna. A simple tracer that is often used is a solu-tion of table salt (NaCl), a conductivity meter being employed to detect the salt solution.There are two different ways of carrying out dilu-tion gauging that use slightly different equations. The ﬁrst puts a known volume of tracer into the river and measures the concentration of the ‘slug’ of tracer as it passes by the measurement point. This is referred to as gulp dilution gauging. The equation for calcu-lating ﬂow by this method is shown in Equation 8.6.QCVCCttd=−()∑0∆ (8.6)Where Q is the unknown streamﬂow, C is the con-centration of tracer either in the slug (t), downstream (d), or background in the stream (0); ∆t is the time interval. The denominator of this equation is the sum of measured concentrations of tracer downstream.The second method uses a continuous injection of tracer into the river and measures the concen-tration downstream. The continuous injection method is better than the slug injection method as it measures the concentration over a greater length of time however it requires a large volume of the tracer. Using the formula listed below the stream discharge can be calculated using Equation 8.7.QqCCCCtdd=−−0 (8.7)Where q is the ﬂow rate of the injected tracer (i.e. injection rate) and all other terms are as for the gulp injection method.Probably the most difﬁcult part of dilution gaug-ing is calculating the distance downstream between where the tracer is injected and the river concentra-tion measuring point (the mixing distance). This can be estimated using Equation 8.8.LCCwgwdZZ=+⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟013072.. (8.8)this can be approximated as mean depth (Goudie et al. 1994). The Manning roughness coefﬁcient is estimated from knowledge of the channel charac-teristics (e.g. vegetation and bed characteristics) in a similar manner to Chezy’s roughness coefﬁcient in Table 8.2. Tables of Manning roughness coefﬁ-cient can be found in Richards (1982), Chow et al. (1988), Goudie et al. (1994), and in other ﬂuvial geomorphological texts.Dilution gaugingDilution gauging works on the principle that the more water there is in a river the more it will dilute a solute added into the river. There is a well-established relationship between the amount of the tracer found naturally in the stream (Co), the  concentration of tracer put into the stream (Ct), the concentration of tracer measured downstream after mixing (Cd), and the stream discharge (Q).

8,"One of the most important tasks in hydrology is to analyse streamﬂow data. These data are continu-ous records of discharge, frequently measured in permanent structures such as ﬂumes and weirs (see Chapter 8). Analysis of these data provides us with three important features:• description of a ﬂow regime• potential for comparison between rivers, and• prediction of possible future river ﬂows.There are well-established techniques available to achieve these, although they are not universally applied in the same manner. This chapter sets out three important methods of analysing streamﬂow: hydrograph analysis, ﬂow duration curves and frequency analysis. These three techniques are explained with reference to worked examples, all drawn from the same data set. The use of data from within the same study area is important for com-parison between the techniques.HYDROGRAPH ANALYSISA hydrograph is a continuous record of stream or river discharge (see Figure 7.1). It is a basic work-ing unit for a hydrologist to understand and inter-pret. The shape of a hydrograph is a response from a particular catchment to a series of unique con-ditions, ranging from the underlying geology and LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of what different hydrological techniques are used for. /H17039A knowledge of hydrograph analysis (including the unit hydrograph). /H17039A knowledge of how to derive and interpret ﬂow duration curves. /H17039A knowledge of how to carry out frequency analysis, particularly for ﬂoods. /H17039An understanding of the aims of hydrological modelling and different strategies to achieve those aims.9STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLINGSTREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING177To overcome the problem of a level baseﬂow separation, a point has to be chosen on the reced-ing limb where it is decided that the discharge has returned to baseﬂow. Exactly where this point will be is not easy to determine. By convention, the point is taken where the recession limb ﬁts an expo-nential curve. This can be detected by plotting the natural log (ln) of discharge (Q) and noting where this line becomes straight, but even using this tech-nique requires an element of subjective judgement. The line drawn between the start and ‘end’ of a storm may be straight (dotted line, see Figure 9.1) or curved (thin solid line, see Figure 9.1) depending on the preference of the hydrologist – Arnold et al. (1995) provides a summary of different automated techniques.In very large catchments, Equation 9.1 has been  applied to derive the time where stormﬂow ends (Linsley et al. 1975). This is the ﬁxed time method which gives the time from peak ﬂow to the end of stormﬂow (τ):τ=0 82782.A (9.1)Where A is the drainage area (km2) and τ is in days.The problem with hydrograph separation is that the technique is highly subjective. There is no physical reasoning why the ‘end’ of a storm should be when the recession limb ﬁts an expo-nential curve; it is pure convention. Equally the shape of the curve between start and ‘end’ has no physical reasoning. It does not address the debate covered in Chapter 7: where does the stormﬂow water come from? Furey and Gupta (2001) pro-vide a hydrograph separation technique that ties into physical characteristics of a catchment and therefore is not as subjective as other techniques, although it still requires considerable interpreta-tion by the user. The general view is that whatever method is used, it should be applied consistently. What hydrograph separation does offer is a means of separating stormﬂow from baseﬂow, something that is needed for the use of the unit hydrograph (see pp. 178–181), and may be useful for hydro-logical interpretation and description.catchment shape to the antecedent wetness, rain-fall intensity and storm duration. The temporal and spatial variations in these underlying conditions make it highly unlikely that two hydrographs will ever be the same. Although there is great varia-tion in the shape of a hydrograph there are common characteristics of a storm hydrograph that can be recognised. These have been described at the start of Chapter 7 where terms such as rising limb, falling limb, recession limb and baseﬂow are explained.Hydrograph separationThe separation of a hydrograph into baseﬂow and stormﬂow is a common task, although never easy. The idea of hydrograph separation is to distin-guish between stormﬂow and baseﬂow so that the amount of water resulting from a storm can be cal-culated. Sometimes further assumptions are made concerning where the water in each component has come from (i.e. groundwater and overland ﬂow) but, as explained in Chapter 7, this is controversial.The simplest form of hydrograph separation is to draw a straight, level line from the point where the hydrograph starts rising until the stream dis-charge reaches the same level again (dashed line in Figure 9.1). However, this is frequently prob-lematic as the stream may not return to its pre-storm level before another storm arrives. Equally, the storm may recharge the baseﬂow enough so that the level is raised after the storm (as shown in Figure 9.1).

work through the steps – in this way you will build a practical understanding of the techniques. For each technique in this chapter there is an explanation of the steps required and also a worked example based on the downloadable data.Deriving the unit hydrographStep 1: Storm selectionTake historical rainfall and streamﬂow records for a catchment and separate out a selection of typical single-peaked storm hydrographs (Figure 9.3). In this example, we will consider one storm, but con-ventionally you would identify ﬁve to seven storms in order to be sure you were getting an ‘average’ hydrograph response. It is important that they are separate storms as the method assumes that one runoff event does not affect another. Once you have identiﬁed your candidate storms, copy and The unit hydrographThe idea of a unit hydrograph was ﬁrst put for-ward by Leroy Sherman, an American engineer working in the 1920s and 1930s. The idea behind the unit hydrograph is simple enough, although it is a somewhat tedious exercise to derive one for a catchment. The fundamental concept of the unit hydrograph is that the shape of a storm hydrograph is determined by the physical characteristics of the catchment. The majority of those physical charac-teristics are static in time, therefore if you can ﬁnd an average hydrograph for a particular storm size then you can use that to predict other storm events. In short: two identical rainfall events that fall on a catchment with exactly the same antecedent condi-tions should produce identical hydrographs.With the unit hydrograph, a hydrologist is try-ing to predict a future storm hydrograph that will result from a particular storm. This is particularly useful as it gives more than just the peak runoff volume and includes the temporal variation in discharge.Sherman (1932) deﬁnes a unit hydrograph as ‘the hydrograph of surface runoff resulting from effective rainfall falling in a unit of time such as 1 hour or 1 day’. The term effective rainfall is taken to be that rainfall that contributes to the storm  hydrograph – it is what remains after all ‘losses’ such as interception, depression storage, soil surface wetting etc. It is the proportion of the rainfall that actually drives the stormﬂow response (Figure 9.2). This is often assumed to be the rainfall that does not inﬁltrate the soil and moves into the stream as overland ﬂow. This is inﬁltration excess or Horto-nian overland ﬂow. Sherman’s ideas ﬁtted well with those of Horton. Sherman assumed that the ‘surface runoff is produced uniformly in space and time over the total catchment area’.All these calculations can be undertaken easily using a spreadsheet package such as Microsoft Excel. For the purposes of explanation we will assume famil-iarity with Excel, but it should be relatively easy to establish equivalent functions in other spreadsheet packages. For all the techniques in this chapter, we recommend that you download the relevant data and Figure 9.2 The concept of effective rainfall and its rela-tionship to the stormﬂow hydrograph.EffectiverainfallLoss curveLagPeakRecession CurveRisinglimbInflection pointSurface runoffBase flowQ (m3/s)I (mm/h)Tt
ABSTREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING179
Step 2: Hydrograph (baseﬂow) separationThe next step is to establish what the stormﬂow component of the hydrograph is. To do this you need to separate the baseﬂow from the stormﬂow; that is, hydrograph separation (see p. 177). You Figure 9.3 Steps in deriving a unit hydrograph for a catchment.

From now on, you will be working with this storm and hydrograph independently but will go back and repeat the steps below for each one of the ﬁve to seven candidate storms you have identiﬁed.180STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLINGtime within the catchment then you can assume it is equal to the effective rainfall. This is an impor-tant assumption of the method: that the effective rainfall is equal to the water equivalent depth of storm runoff. It is also assumed that the effective rainfall all occurred during the height of the storm (i.e. during the period of highest rainfall intensity). That period of high rainfall intensity becomes the time for the unit hydrograph.Step 5: Calculate the ordinates of the unit hydrographThe unit hydrograph is deﬁned as the stormﬂow that results from one unit of effective rainfall. In Step 2 you calculated the stormﬂow discharge (m3/s) at each time step by subtracting the base-ﬂow from the total discharge. In Step 4 you calcu-lated the effective rainfall. By ‘ordinates’ of the unit hydrograph we mean the values of the unit hydro-graph at each time step. To derive this you need to divide the values of stormﬂow (m3/s) (i.e. each value on the storm hydrograph – Step 2) by the amount of effective rainfall (mm) (from Step 4) to give the unit hydrograph. This gives the unusual units of the y-axis of the unit hydrograph (m3/s/mm) – but think about what this means – this is the discharge (m3/s) per millimetre of effective rainfall during the time unit. The resultant unit hydrograph looks a bit like the original hydrograph but has time since the storm as the x-axis and storm discharge per mm of effective rainfall (m3/s/mm) as the y-axis.Step 6: Creating an average hydrographSteps 1 to 5 above related to one storm only – but we wouldn’t know whether this would have been a representative storm or not. To obtain a more rep-resentative hydrograph, Steps 2 to 5 would need to be repeated for all candidate hydrographs selected in Step 1 and an average unit hydrograph obtained by merging the curves together. This is achieved by averaging the value of stormﬂow for each unit of time for every derived unit hydrograph. The result will need to decide which method to use and later apply this approach consistently for all storms. Once you have decided the ‘start’ and ‘end’ points of the baseﬂow separation line, you will need to use linear interpolation (e.g. the FORECAST function in Excel) to calculate the baseﬂow at each time step along the baseﬂow separation line. As you already have the total recorded ﬂow in the hydrograph, subtracting the interpolated baseﬂow value at each time step will leave you with the stormﬂow compo-nent of the hydrograph for each time step – in other words what share of the total discharge at each time step was stormﬂow. At this point you are still work-ing in the original units of the hydrograph (m3/s).Step 3: Calculate the total stormﬂow volumeIn the next step you need to work out the total vol-ume of water that contributed to the storm. Refer-ring back to Figure 7.3, this is of course the area between the baseﬂow separation line and the hydro-graph. This can be done either by measuring the area under the stormﬂow hydrograph or as an inte-gral of the curve. In Excel you could take the average stormﬂow (m3/s) for each time step and multiply it by the time step duration (s). This would give you the stormﬂow volume (m3) in each time step, and by summing these across the storm duration you would have an estimate of the total storm ﬂow volume.Step 4: Calculate the water equivalent depthIn the unit hydrograph method, we assume that the runoff is generated evenly across the catchment. So what rainfall would be required to generate the surface runoff volume we have calculated? If you then divide the total volume in the storm by the catchment area, you will have expressed the runoff as a water equivalent depth. In doing so you will need to remember to check your unit conversions; because it relates to the driving rainfall, water equivalent depth is expressed in mm. If this is assumed to have occurred uniformly over space and STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING181would be a more robust estimate of the stormﬂow that is generated for each mm of effective rainfall that occurs. This could be thought of as the ‘storm-ﬂow signature’ of the catchment which can then be used to estimate the stormﬂow hydrograph arising from a storm of any other depth or duration – this is the value of the method (see next section for how this is done). It is also possible to derive different unit hydrographs for different rain durations and intensities, but this is not covered here (see Maid-ment (1992), or Shaw et al. (2011) for more details).Using the unit hydrographThe unit hydrograph obtained from the steps described here theoretically gives you the runoff that can be expected per mm of effective rainfall in 1 hour. In order to use the unit hydrograph for predicting a storm it is necessary to estimate the ‘effective rainfall’ that will result from the storm rainfall. This is not an easy task and is one of the main hurdles in using the method. In deriving the unit hydrograph the assumption has been made that ‘effective rainfall’ is the rainfall which does not inﬁltrate but is routed to the stream as over-land ﬂow (Hortonian). The same assumption has to be made when utilising the unit hydrograph. To do this it is necessary to have some indication of the inﬁltration characteristics for the catchment concerned, and also of the antecedent soil moisture conditions. The former can be achieved through ﬁeld experimentation and the latter through the use of an antecedent precipitation index (API). Engineering textbooks give examples of how to use the API to derive effective rainfall. The idea is that antecedent soil moisture is controlled by how long ago rain has fallen and how large that event was. The wetter a catchment is prior to a storm, the more effective rainfall will be produced.Once the effective rainfall has been established, it is a relatively simple task to add the resultant unit hydrographs together to form the resultant storm hydrograph. Before doing this though, it is impor-tant to understand the three principles upon which the method is based (Figure 9.4):Figure 9.4 Illustration of the principles underpinning application of the unit hydrograph.

As described in Chapter 7, this is not a reasonable assumption to make in many areas of the world.• The surface runoff occurs uniformly over the catchment because the rainfall is uniform over the catchment. Another assumption that is dif-ﬁcult to justify.• The relationship between effective rainfall and surface runoff does not vary with time (i.e. the hydrograph shape remains the same between the data period of derivation and prediction). This would assume no land-use change within the catchment, as this could well affect the storm hydrograph shape.Given the assumptions listed above it would seem extremely foolhardy to use the unit hydrograph as a predictive tool. However, the unit hydrograph has been used successfully for many years in numer-ous different hydrological situations. In fact, many approaches to the estimation of hydrographs across the world are based on this fundamental thinking. It is a very simple method of deriv-ing a storm hydrograph from a relatively small amount of data. The fact that it does work (i.e. produces meaningful predictions of storm hydro-graphs), despite being theoretically ﬂawed, would seem to raise questions about our understanding of hydrological processes. The answer to why it works may well lie in the way that it is applied, especially the use of effective rainfall. This is a nebulous concept that is difﬁcult to describe from ﬁeld measurements. It is possible that in moving from actual to effective rainfall, there is a blurring of processes that discounts some of the assump-tions listed above. The unit hydrograph is a black box model of stormﬂow (see end of this chapter) and as such hides many different processes within. The simple concept that the hydrograph shape is a reﬂection of the static characteristics and all the dynamic processes going on in a catchment makes it highly applicable but less able to be explained in terms of hydrological theory.The principle of invarianceOnce you have derived your unit hydrograph ordi-nates, you have established a relationship between effective rainfall of 1 mm and how this generates runoff over time. This principle assumes that this relationship holds true all the time and does not vary by storm or seasonally (i.e. it is invariant).The principle of proportionalityThis principle assumes a direct relationship between the magnitude of effective rainfall and the runoff generated. In other words, if you double the effective rainfall, you can simply double the mag-nitude of your unit hydrograph ordinates; doubling the effective rainfall will double the stormﬂow.The principle of superpositionWhilst the unit hydrograph is the amount of stormﬂow generated for 1 mm falling in 1 hour, this principle allows us to determine what hap-pens when we have storms that last for more than  1 hour. This is implemented by drawing the hydro-graph that results from the ﬁrst hour and then drawing the second hydrograph that would result from whatever effective rainfall occurred in the second hour – but importantly – offset by 1 hour, as the response only started in the second hour. If the storm was 3 hours long you would have three hydrographs, each offset by 1 hour with respect to each other. The total hydrograph is estimated by simply adding all three together at each time step, a process known as convolution of the unit hydrograph. This is best understood by a practical example – see the worked example as an illustra-tion of how this is done.Limitations of the unit hydrographAs indicated above, the unit hydrograph has several assumptions that at ﬁrst appearance would seem to make it inapplicable in many situations. The assumptions can be summarised as:STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING183series of multiple regression equations to predict peak runoff amount, time to peak ﬂow, and the time to the end of the recession limb based on the measurable characteristics. Although this has been carried out relatively successfully it is only appli-cable to the UK as this is where the derivative data was from. In another climatic area the hydrological response is likely to be different for a similar catch-ment. The UK is a relatively homogeneous climatic area with a dense network of river ﬂow gauging, which allowed the study to be carried out. In areas of the world with great heterogeneity in climate and sparse river monitoring it would be extremely difﬁcult to use this approach.The synthetic unit hydrographThe synthetic unit hydrograph is an attempt to derive the unit hydrograph from measurable catchment characteristics rather than from ﬂow data. This is highly desirable as it would give the opportunity to predict stormﬂows when having no historical streamﬂow data; a common predicament around the world. The Institute of Hydrology in the UK (now the Centre for Ecology &  Hydrology – CEH) carried out an extensive study into producing synthetic unit hydrographs for catchments, based on factors such as the catchment size, degree of urbanisation, etc. (NERC 1975). They produced a Worked example of the unit hydrographThe Tanllwyth is a small (0.98 km2) headwater tributary of the River Severn in mid-Wales. The catchment is monitored by the Centre for Ecol-ogy and Hydrology (formerly the Institute of Hydrology) as part of the Plynlimon catchment experiment. For this example, a storm was chosen from July 1982 as it is a simple single-peaked hydrograph (see Figure 9.3).

FLOW DURATION CURVESAn understanding of how much water is ﬂow-ing down a river is fundamental to hydrology. Of particular interest for both ﬂood and low ﬂow hydrology is the question of how representative or ‘typical’ a certain ﬂow is. This can be addressed by looking at the frequency of daily ﬂows and some statistics that can be derived from the frequency analysis. For example, it might be of interest to know which ﬂows occur less than 5 per cent of the time. One convenient way of showing this is a ﬂow duration curve, one of the essential basic tools of a hydrologist.Whereas a hydrograph shows the sequence of ﬂows, in a ﬂow duration curve the time sequence of the ﬂows is lost, but other valuable information based on the frequency analysis is gained. Flow duration curves show on the y-axis the ﬂow and on the x-axis the percentage of time that the ﬂow To apply the unit hydrograph to a small storm, hydrographs were added together for each amount of effective rainfall. The resultant total hydrograph is shown as the purple line in Figure 9.8. The discharge values in the simu-lated hydrograph are much larger than those in the original storm hydrograph despite what appears to be a smaller storm. This is because the simulated hydrograph is working on effec-tive rainfall rather than actual rainfall. Effective rainfall is the rain that doesn’t inﬁltrate and is theoretically available for storm runoff. A low effective rainfall value may represent a high actual rainfall value.186STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLINGfrequency Q-values. One way of getting around this is to undertake a log transformation of the data. In our example we take the natural log (LN function in Excel) of the ﬂows and plot these. This has the effect of straightening out the ﬂow duration curve so it is easier to read. Values from the x-axis can be converted back to normal ﬂow by taking the inverse of the transformed ﬂow.The data most commonly used to derive a ﬂow duration curve are daily mean ﬂows: the average ﬂow for each day (note well that this is not the same as a mean daily ﬂow, which is the average of a series of daily ﬂows). To derive a representative ﬂow dura-tion curve the daily mean ﬂow data are required for a long period of time, in excess of 5 years. That is not to say that a ﬂow duration curve cannot be derived for a particular year – as in Figure 9.9 – it is is equalled or exceeded. The ﬂow associated with a particular frequency is known as a ‘Q-value’. The 50 per cent value or ‘Q50’ therefore represents the median ﬂow, an important indicator. This means that half the time ﬂow in the river is higher than the Q50 discharge, and half the time it will be lower. In Figure 9.9, the value marked by a dot is the Q30 value – read as ‘30 per cent of the time the ﬂow equals or exceeds about 0.67 m3/s’. Other indica-tor statistics commonly used include the Q95 and Q99 values (indicators of low ﬂows), whereas the Q10 and Q5 are high ﬂow indicators (ﬂows only exceed these values 10 per cent and 5 per cent of the time, respectively).You will also notice from Figure 9.9 that the ﬂow duration curve appears exponential – this makes it difﬁcult to read off the very low and very high

Percentage of the /g415me equalled or exceeded (%)Q300.67STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING187this would have been a very laborious process. With Excel it can be done relatively easily using the FRE-QUENCY function. The sum of all the frequency counts (9437 in the worked example) should equal the total number of observations in the record. The next column – relative frequency – is simply the respective frequency divided by the total number of observations and expressed as a percentage. So in the worked example, 2.65 per cent of ﬂows were in the ﬁrst class. The cumulative frequency is then calculated by starting from the highest ﬂow class and then adding each successive relative frequency value – so that by the time you reach the class rep-resenting the lowest ﬂow category you should total 100 per cent. The percentage cumulative frequency is assumed to equal the percentage of time that the ﬂow is exceeded.Step 2The actual ﬂow duration curve is created by plot-ting the percentage cumulative frequency on the x-axis against the mid-point of the class interval on the y-axis. Where two ﬂow duration curves are presented on the same axes they need to be stan-dardised for direct comparison. One way of doing this is to divide the values on the y-axis (mid-point of class interval) by the average daily ﬂow for the record length. This makes the y-axis a percentage of the average ﬂow (see Figure 9.10).As mentioned earlier, the presentation of a ﬂow duration curve may be improved by either plotting on a special type of graph paper or transforming the data. The type of graph paper often used has the x-axis transformed in the form of a known distribu-tion such as the Gumbel or Log Pearson. A natu-ral log transformation of the ﬂow values (y-axis) achieves a similar effect, although this is not neces-sarily standard practice.A quicker method for deriving a ﬂow duration curveHistorically the process of constructing the ﬂow duration curve was time consuming, and even with just if you want it to be representative of the range of natural variation, you need as long a record as possible.There are a number of methods for creating a ﬂow duration curve, but underpinning all is essen-tially a frequency analysis of ﬂows. Prior to the advent of computers this was a painstaking process. The worked example provided here shows how the ﬂow duration curve would have been constructed historically. The example uses 26 years of data for the upper reaches of the river Wye in mid-Wales, UK (see pp. 183–185). We present this method because it is helpful in understanding the funda-mentals of the process, and recommend that you do it once to help cement this understanding. Hav-ing understood the fundamental principle, we will then show you a quicker method that is available through spreadsheet functions. In practice, hydrol-ogists normally use specialist software to calculate and display ﬂow duration curves.Flow duration curveStep 1A table is derived that has, as a ﬁrst column, the frequency of occurrence of the ﬂows for each of the ﬂow classes that you select to represent the range of ﬂows. This is simply the number of times across the full record the daily ﬂow fell into that class (or range of ﬂows). In the worked example in Table 9.1 for example, there were 250 instances of ﬂow being less than 0.05 m3/s. In deciding on the classes, it is important that a small class interval (or ‘bin’ as they are sometimes referred to in frequency analy-sis software packages) is used; too large an interval and information will be lost from the ﬂow dura-tion curve. The method for choosing the best class interval is essentially through trial and error. As a general rule, you should aim not to have more than around 10 per cent of your values within a single class interval. If you have more than this you start to lose precision in plotting. As shown in the worked example, it is not essential that the same interval is used throughout. As mentioned earlier, historically 188STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING
has particularly low ﬂows or particularly high ﬂows. This type of hydrological response is found in lime-stone or chalk catchments where there is a high base-ﬂow in the summer (groundwater derived) and high inﬁltration rates during storm events. In contrast the catchment shown with the dotted line has far more variation. During dry periods it has a very low ﬂow, but responds to rainfall events with a high ﬂow. This is characteristic of impermeable upland catchments or streamﬂow in dryland areas. Baseﬂow dominated catchments typically have a much ﬂatter ﬂow dura-tion compared with ﬂashier stormwater dominated catchments – so the slope of the ﬂow duration curve tells us something about storagethe beneﬁt of the FREQUENCY function in Excel it is still laborious. A much quicker alternative is to use the PERCENTILE.EXC function in Excel. Let’s say you were interested in the Q10 – remember this is the ﬂow that is equalled or exceeded 10 per cent of the time, or in other words, 90 per cent of the ﬂows are less than this. By selecting your whole data record and providing the parameter ‘0.9’ to represent the 90th percentile, the PERCENTILE.EXC function will return the Q10 value. The ﬂow duration curve can easily be created by calculating all the Q values (for the parameters 0 to 1) representing all percen-tiles. The ﬂow duration curve is then just the Q value plotted against the corresponding ﬂow. This method is of course much easier, but what is being done is hidden behind the concept of a percentile. This is the reason for illustrating the historical method ﬁrst – it allows a more intuitive understanding of what lies behind a ﬂow duration curve.Interpreting a ﬂow duration curveThe shape of a ﬂow duration curve can tell a lot about the hydrological regime of a catchment. In Figure 9.10 two ﬂow duration curves of contrasting shape are shown. With the dotted line there is a large difference between the highest and lowest ﬂow values, whereas for the solid line there is far less variation. This tells us that the catchment shown by the solid line never

Worked example of ﬂow duration curveThe Wye river has its headwaters in central Wales and ﬂows into the Severn at the head of the Severn Estuary. In its upper reaches it is part of the Plynlimon hydrological experiment run by the Institute of Hydrology (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) from the early 1970s. At Plynlimon the Wye is a small (10.5 km2) grassland catchment with an underlying geology of relatively impermeable Ordovician shale. The data used to derive a ﬂow duration curve here are from the Upper Wye for a period from 1970 until 1995, consisting of 9,437 values of daily mean ﬂow in cumecs (Figure 9.11).Figure 9.11 Flow duration curve for the river Wye (1970–1995 data).
STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING189The frequency analysis for the Wye gives Table 9.1.The ﬂow duration curve is derived by plotting the percentage cumulative frequency (x-axis) against the mid-point of the daily mean ﬂow class intervals (y-axis), except for the highest ﬂow class where you should use the maximum ﬂow. When this is plotted it forms the exponen-tial shape that is normal for this type of catch-ment (see Figure 9.11). In order to see more detail on the curve the ﬂow values can be logged (natural log). This is shown in Figure 9.12. The ﬂow statistics Q95, Q50 and Q10 can either be read from the graph (see Figure 9.12) or interpolated from the original frequency table (remembering to use the mid-points of the class interval). A summary of the ﬂow statistics for the upper Wye are shown in Table 9.2.

For example, people who may have just endured the 100-year event may mistakenly believe that this ﬂood would not happen for another 100 years. This is not what is meant by return period. It also does not mean that a 100-year ﬂood must happen every 100 years. The technical deﬁnition of the return period is the long term average inter-val between the exceedences of a ﬂood of a certain magnitude – or to express it a little more simply – the long term average time between two ﬂoods of a given size. The implication is that it is possible to experience two 100-year events within a few years. Consider someone living next to a river; it can be shown mathematically that that person (assuming a life span of 70 years) has a 51 per cent chance of experiencing the 100-year ﬂood in their lifetime, and a 15 per cent chance of experiencing it twice. Mis-understanding of the concept of return period and communication of ﬂood risk has led to the sugges-tion that the term ‘recurrence interval’ should rather be used (ICE 2001). In technical contexts we prefer to use the term annual probability of ﬂooding or APF – we will deﬁne this more precisely later.Flood frequency analysis is concerned with peak ﬂows, and normally these are recorded separately to daily mean ﬂows. In the United Kingdom, for example, gauging stations record 15-minute samples. These values are averaged over a 24-hour period to give the gauged daily ﬂow or the daily mean ﬂow. However, the highest ﬂow out of the 15-minute samples is also recorded – this is the peak ﬂow for the day. It is the daily mean ﬂows that are used for the ﬂow duration curve, but daily peak ﬂows that are used for ﬂood frequency analysis. In situations where peak ﬂows are not recorded one can use the daily mean, provided one accepts that this would represent an underestimate of peaks. There are two different ways that a peak ﬂow can be deﬁned:• the single maximum peak within a year of record giving an annual maximum series (sometimes abbreviated to AMAX); orFREQUENCY ANALYSISThe analysis of how often an event is likely to occur is an important concept in hydrology. It is the application of statistical theory into an area that affects many people’s lives, whether it be through ﬂooding or low ﬂows and drought. Both of these are considered here, although because they use similar techniques the main emphasis is on ﬂood frequency analysis. The technique is a statistical examination of the frequency–magnitude relation-ship discussed in Chapters 1 and 7. It is an attempt to place a probability on the likelihood of a certain event occurring. Predominantly it is concerned with the low-frequency, high-magnitude events (e.g. a large ﬂood or a very low river ﬂow).It is important to differentiate between the uses of ﬂow duration curves and frequency analy-sis. Flow duration curves tell us the percentage of time that a ﬂow is above or below a certain level. This is average data and describes the overall ﬂow regime. Flood frequency analysis is concerned only with peak ﬂows: the probability of a certain ﬂood recurring. Conversely, low ﬂow frequency analy-sis is concerned purely with the lowest ﬂows and the probability of them recurring.Flood frequency analysisFlood frequency analysis is probably the most important hydrological technique and seeks to establish the probability of ﬂoods of certain mag-nitudes occurring, based on what has happened in the past and for which we have observed data. This brings into focus one of the major challenges in ﬂood frequency analysis – often we don’t have sufﬁcient observed data. A second major challenge is that even if we do have reasonable data, is the past a good indication of what might happen in the future? Changes in catchments (urbanisation, impoundments) and climate change may mean that the past hydrological record is a poor indica-tor of future conditions – particularly when we are interested in design estimates for structures that we want to last well into the future.STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING191The ﬁrst step in carrying out ﬂood frequency analysis is to obtain the data series (in this case annual maxima). The annual maximum series should be for as long as the data record allows. The greater the length of record the more certainty can be attached to the prediction of average recur-rence interval. Many hydrological database soft-ware packages (e.g. HYDSYS) will give annual maxima data automatically, but some forethought is required on what annual period is to be used. There is an assumption made in ﬂood frequency analysis that the peak ﬂows are independent of each other (i.e. they are not part of the same storm). If a calendar year is chosen for a humid temper-ate environment in the northern hemisphere, or a tropical region, it is possible that the maximum river ﬂow will occur in the transition between years (i.e. December/January). It is possible for a storm to last over the 31 December/1 January period and the same storm to be the maximum ﬂow value for both years. If the ﬂow regime is dominated by snow melt then it is important to avoid splitting the hydrological year at times of high melt (e.g. spring and early summer). To avoid this it is neces-sary to choose your hydrological year as changing during the period of lowest ﬂow. This may take some initial investigation of the data. For example, because high ﬂows are normally experienced in the northern hemisphere winter, in the UK the water or hydrological year runs from 1 October to 31 September. This means the whole wet season is contained within one water year.All ﬂood frequency analysis is concerned with the analysis of frequency histograms and probability distributions. Consequently the ﬁrst data analysis step should be to draw a frequency histogram. It is often useful to convert the frequency into a relative frequency (divide the number of readings in each class interval by the total number of readings in the data series).The worked example given is for a data set on the river Wye in mid-Wales (see pp. 195–196).  On looking at the histogram of the Wye data set (Figure 9.14) the ﬁrst obvious point to note is that it is not normally distributed (i.e. it is not a classic • any ﬂow above a certain threshold value, giving a partial duration series, also known as peaks over threshold (sometimes abbreviated to POT).Figure 9.13 shows the difference between these two data series. There are arguments for and against the use of either data series in ﬂood frequency analysis. Annual maximum may miss a large storm event where it occurs more than once during a year (as in the 1981 case in Figure 9.13), but it does pro-vide a continuous series of data that are relatively easy to process. The setting of a threshold storm (the horizontal line in Figure 9.13) is critical in analysis of the partial duration series, something that requires considerable experience to get right (typically one would aim for between three and ﬁve events per year). The most common analysis is on annual maximum series, the simplest form, which is described here. If the data series is longer than 10 years then the annual maxima can be used; for very short periods of record the partial duration series can be used.

192STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING3 The average recurrence interval: T(X). This is expressed in years and is sometimes referred to as the return period, although this is mislead-ing. T(X) is a statistical term meaning the chance of excedence once every T years over a long record. This should not be interpreted as meaning that is exactly how many years are likely between certain size ﬂoods.4 The annual probability of ﬂooding: APF. This is P(X) expressed as a percentage, and also the recip-rocal of the average recurrence interval T(X) – so the 100-year event has an APR of 1 per cent (1/100 years = 0.01 = 1 per cent). Similarly the 1 in 30 year event has an APF of 3.3 per cent.PXFXTXPXFX()=−()()=()=−()1111 (9.2)APFTX%()=()⋅1100It is possible to read the values of F(X) from a cumulative probability curve; this provides the simplest method of carrying out ﬂood frequency analyses. One difﬁculty with using this method is that you must choose the class intervals for the histogram carefully so that the probability density function is an accurate representation of the data. Too large an interval and the distribution may be shaped incorrectly, too small and holes in the dis-tribution will appear.One way of avoiding the difﬁculties of choosing the best class interval is to use a rank order distribu-tion. This is often referred to as a plotting position formula.The Weibull formulaThe ﬁrst step in the method is to rank your annual maximum series data from low to high. In doing this you are assuming that each data point (i.e. the maximum ﬂood event for a particular year) is inde-pendent of any others. This means that the year that the ﬂood occurred in becomes irrelevant.bell-shaped curve). It is important to grasp the signif-icance of the non-normal distribution for two reasons:1 Common statistical techniques that require nor-mally distributed data (e.g. t-tests etc.) cannot be applied in ﬂood frequency analysis.2 It shows what you might expect: small events are more common than large ﬂoods, but that very large ﬂood events do occur; i.e. a high magnitude, low frequency relationship.If you were to assume that the data series is inﬁ-nitely large in number and the class intervals were made extremely small, then a smooth curve can be drawn through the histogram. This is the probabil-ity density function which represents the smoothed version of your frequency histogram.In ﬂood frequency analysis there are three inter-related terms of interest. These terms are interre-lated mathematically, as described in Equation 9.2 in the text below.1 The probability of excedence: P(X). This is the annual probability that a ﬂow (Q) is greater than, or equal to, a value X. The probability is normally expressed as a unitary percentage (i.e. on a scale between 0 and 1).2 The relative frequency: F(X). This is the prob-ability of the ﬂow (Q) being less than a value X. This is also expressed as a unitary percentage.Figure 9.14 Frequency distribution of the Wye annual maximum series.
STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING193recurrence interval of 50 years but only have 25 years of streamﬂow record. In order to do this you need to ﬁt a distribution to your data. There are several different ways of doing this, the method described here uses the method of moments based on the Gumbel distribution. Other distributions that are used by hydrologists include the Log- Pearson Type III and log normal. The choice of  distribution is often based on personal preference and regional bias (i.e. the distribution that seems to ﬁt ﬂow regimes for a particular region).Method of momentsIf you assume that the data ﬁts a Gumbel distri-bution then you can use the method of moments to calculate F(X) values. Moments are statistical descriptors of a data set. The ﬁrst moment of a data set is the mean; the second moment the standard deviation; the third moment skewness; the fourth kurtosis. To use the formulae below (Equations 9.5–9.7) you must ﬁrst ﬁnd the mean (Q̅) and stan-dard deviation (σQ) of your annual maximum data series. The symbol e in Equations 9.5–9.7 is the base number for natural logarithms or the exponen-tial number (≈ 2.7183).FXbXa()=−−−()ee (9.5)aQb=−0 5772 . (9.6)bQ=πσ6 (9.7)With knowledge of F(X) you can ﬁnd P(X) and the average recurrence interval (T(X)) for a certain size of ﬂow: X. The formulae above can be rear-ranged to give you the size of ﬂow that might be expected for a given average recurrence interval (Equation 9.8):XabTXTX=−()()−⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟1111nn (9.8)Taking the rank value, the next step is to calcu-late the F(X) term using Equation 9.3. In this case, r refers to the rank of an individual ﬂood event (X) within the data series and N is the total number of data points (i.e. the number of years of record):FXrN()=+1 (9.3)In applying this formula there are two important points to note:1 The value of F(X) can never reach 1 (i.e. it is asymptotic towards the value 1).2 If you rank your data from high to low (i.e. the other way around) then you will be calculating the P(X) value rather than F(X). This is easily rectiﬁed by using the formula linking the two.The worked example on pp. 188–189 gives the F(X), P(X) and T(X) for a small catchment in mid-Wales (Table 9.3).The Weibull formula is simple to use and effec-tive but is not always the best description of an annual maximum series data. Some users suggest that a better ﬁt to the data is provided by the Grin-gorten formula (Equation 9.4), but there are also many others:FXrN()=−+044012.. (9.4)As illustrated in the worked example, the differ-ence between these two formulae is not great and often the use of either one is down to personal preference.Extrapolating beyond your data setThe probabilities derived from the Weibull and Gringorten formulae give a good description of the ﬂood frequency within the measured stream record but do not provide enough data when you need to extrapolate beyond a known time series. This is a common hydrological problem: we need to make an estimate on the size of a ﬂood within an average 194STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLINGYou need to multiply your calculated ﬂood esti-mates by these factors and then add or subtract these values from the calculated estimates to derive the upper and lower conﬁdence boundar-ies. You will see from Table 9.3 that these are a function of the length of record you have and the recurrence interval that you are trying to esti-mate. So if you had 50 years of data and were trying to estimate the 100-year event, then you would be adding just over half of your original estimate onto the estimate as the upper bound-ary and subtracting just under 40 per cent for the lower boundary. We would be 90 per cent sure that the true ﬂood estimate was somewhere between this broad range (see the worked example for what this looks like for the small catchment in the upper Wye).In the formula above, ln represents the natural loga-rithm. To ﬁnd the ﬂow for a 50-year average recur-rence interval you must ﬁnd the natural logarithm of (50/49) and then the natural logarithm of this result.Using this method it is possible to ﬁnd the resultant ﬂow for a given average recurrence interval that is beyond the length of your time series. The further away from the length of your time series you move the more error is likely to be involved in the estimate. As a general rule of thumb it is considered reasonable to extrapolate up to twice the length of your streamﬂow record, but you should not go beyond this. Thompson (1999) gives coefﬁcients for calculating the upper and lower 90 per cent conﬁdence limits using the lognormal or Gumbel I distribution (Table 9.3).

In this case it is an annual maximum series for the period 1970 until 1997 (inclusive).  In order to establish the best time of year to set a cut-off for the hydrological year, all daily mean ﬂ  ows above a threshold value (4.5 m 3 /s) were plotted against their day number ( Figure 9.15 ). It is clear from  Figure 9.15  that high ﬂ  ows can occur at almost any time of the year although at the start and end of the summer (150 = 30 May; 250 = 9 September) there are slight gaps. The hydrological year from June to June is sensible to choose for this example.     The Weibull and Gringorten position plot-ting formulae are both applied to the data (see  Table 9.4 ) and the  F ( X ),  P ( X ) and  T ( X ) (average recurrence interval) values calculated. The data look different from those in  Figure 9.15  and from the ﬂ  ow duration curve because they are the peak ﬂ  ow values recorded in each year. This is the peak value of each storm hydrograph, which is not the same as the peak mean daily ﬂ  ow values.  When the Weibull and Gringorten values are plotted together ( Figure 9.16 ) it can be seen that there is very little difference between them.

Low ﬂow frequency analysisWhere frequency analysis is concerned with low ﬂows rather than ﬂoods, the data required are an annual minimum series. The same problem is found as for annual maximum series: which annual year to use when you have to assume that the annual mini-mum ﬂows are independent of each other. At mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere the calendar year is the most sensible, as you would expect the lowest ﬂows to be in the summer months (i.e. the middle of the year of record). Elsewhere an analysis of when low ﬂows occur needs to be carried out so that the hydrological year avoids splitting in the middle of a low ﬂow period. In this case, P(X) refers to the probability of an annual minimum greater than or equal to the value X. The formulae used are the same as for ﬂood frequency analysis (Weibull etc.).There is one major difference between ﬂood fre-quency and low ﬂow frequency analysis which has Applying the method of moments and Gumbel formula to the data give some interesting results. The values used in the formula are shown below and can be easily computed. When the formula is applied to ﬁnd the ﬂow values for an average recur-rence interval of 50 years it is calculated as 39.1 m3/s. This is less than the largest ﬂow during the record which under the Weibull formula has an average recurrence interval of 27 years. This dis-crepancy is due to the method of moments formula treating the highest ﬂow as an extreme outlier. If we invert the formula we can calculate that a ﬂood with a ﬂow of 48.87 m3/s (the largest on record) has an average recurrence interval of around 300 years.Figure 9.18 shows the ﬂood magnitude estimates for the site with the associated 90 per cent con-ﬁdence limits. The estimate for the ﬂood with a 100-year recurrence interval is therefore expressed more realistically as between 22.4 and 64.2 m3/s at 90 per cent conﬁdence.Figure 9.16 Frequency of ﬂows less than X plotted against the X values. The F(X) values are calculated using both the Weibull and Gringorten formulae.
Figure 9.17 Frequency of ﬂows less than a value X. NB The F(X) values on the x-axis have undergone a transformation to ﬁt the Gumbel distribution (see text for explanation).
When the data are plotted with a transforma-tion to ﬁt the Gumbel distribution they almost ﬁt a straight line (Figure 9.17), suggesting that they do ﬁt a distribution for extreme values such as the Gumbel but that a larger data set would be required to make an absolute straight line. A longer period of records is likely to make the extreme outlier lie further along the x-axis. The plot presented here has transformed the data to ﬁt the Gumbel distribution. Another method of presenting this data is to plot them on Gum-bel distribution paper. This provides a non-linear scale for the x-axis based on the Gumbel distribution.STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING197

Figure 9.18 Flood magnitude estimates with the 90% conﬁdence limits.huge implications for the statistical methods used: there is a ﬁnite limit on how low a ﬂow can be. In theory a ﬂood can be of inﬁnite size, whereas it is not possible for a low ﬂow to be less than zero (negative ﬂows should not exist in fresh water hydrology). This places a limit on the shape of a probability distribution, effectively truncating it on the left-hand side (see Figure 9.19).The statistical techniques described on pp. 192–193 (for ﬂood frequency analysis) assume a full log-normal distribution and cannot be easily applied for low ﬂows. Another way of looking at this problem is shown in Figure 9.20 where the probabilities calculated from the Weibull formula are plotted against the annual minimum ﬂow values. The data ﬁt a straight line, but if we extrapolate the line further it would intersect the x-axis at a value of approximately 0.95. The implication from this is that there is a 5 per cent chance of having a ﬂow less than zero (i.e. a negative ﬂow). The way around this Figure 9.19 Two probability density functions. The usual log-normal distribution (solid line) is contrasted with the truncated log-normal distribution (broken line) that is possible with low ﬂows (where the mini-mum ﬂow can equal zero).
198STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING3 There is an inherent assumption made that the hydrological regime has remained static during the complete period of record. This may not be true where land use, or climate change, has occurred in the catchment (see Chapter 11).COMPUTER MODELLING IN HYDROLOGYThe easiest way of thinking about a hydrological model is to envisage streamﬂow as a series of num-bers. Each number represents the volume of water that has ﬂowed down the stream during a certain time period. A numerical model attempts to pro-duce its own set of numbers, ‘simulating’ the ﬂow of water down the river. There are many different ways of achieving this simulation, as will be dis-cussed in the following section.A model (whether mathematical, numerical or scale) is a simpliﬁcation of reality. We simplify reality because the complexity of the natural world makes it difﬁcult to understand all the processes and interactions occurring. A laboratory experi-ment is a similar simpliﬁcation of reality; normally we are controlling all the inputs for an experiment and allowing some controlled change in a variable in order to observe the result. In constructing a computer model we are normally trying to build as good a representation of hydrological reality as we can, given our understanding of the key hydrologi-cal processes and our ability to represent these as a series of equations.Computer modelling strategiesBlack box modelsThe simplest forms of numerical models simulate streamﬂow as a direct relationship between it and another measured variable. As an example, a rela-tionship can be derived between annual rainfall and annual runoff for a catchment (see Figure 9.21). The regression line drawn to correlate rainfall and run-off is a simulation model. If you know the annual rainfall for the catchment then you can simulate the annual runoff, using the regression relationship. to describe the technique here (see Shaw 1994, or Wang and Singh 1995 for more detail). Gordon et al. (1992) provide a simple method of overcom-ing this problem, without using complicated line-ﬁtting procedures.Limitations of frequency analysisAs with any estimation technique there are several limitations in the application of frequency analysis; three of these are major:1 The estimation technique is only as good as the streamﬂow records that it is derived from. Where the records are short or of dubious qual-ity very little of worth can be achieved through frequency analysis. As a general rule of thumb you should not extrapolate average recurrence intervals beyond twice the length of your data set, and where possible always provide conﬁ-dence estimates. There is a particular problem with ﬂood frequency analysis in that the very large ﬂoods can create problems for ﬂow gauges and therefore this extreme data may be of dubi-ous quality (see pp. 164–166).2 The assumption is made that each storm or low ﬂow event is independent of another used in the data set. This is relatively easy to guard against in annual maximum (or minimum) series, but more difﬁcult for a peak threshold series.Figure 9.20 Probability values (calculated from the Weibull sorting formula) plotted on a log scale against values of annual minimum ﬂow (hypothetical values).
STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING199This type of model is referred to as a black box model as it puts all the different hydrological pro-cesses that we know inﬂuence the way that water moves from rainfall to runoff into a single regres-sion relationship. Because these types of models are based on observed data they are also called empiri-cal or metric models. The simplicity of this type of model makes it widely applicable but its usefulness is restricted by the end-product from the model. In the example given, the regression model may be useful to estimate annual runoff in areas with the same geology and land use but it will not tell you anything about runoff at timescales less than 1 year or under different climatic and geomorphologic conditions. Another, frequently used example of a black box model is the unit hydrograph (described earlier in this chapter).Figure 9.21 Annual rainfall vs. runoff data (1980–2000) for the Glendhu tussock catchment in the South Island of New Zealand.Source: Data courtesy of Barry Fahey
Case studySOIL CURVE NUMBERS FOR RAINFALL–RUNOFF RELATIONSHIPAn empirical, black-box approach to predicting runoff from rainfall is the Curve Number (CN) approach developed by the United States Depart-ment of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS 1972). The CN methodology has been used extensively in the USA for modelling rainfall–runoff relationships. The fundamental equation at the heart of the CN method is described in Equation 9.9.QPIPISaa=−()−+2 (9.9)Where Q is the surface runoff (mm); P is the storm precipitation total (mm); Ia is the initial abstrac-tions (all losses before runoff begins, e.g. surface storage, rainfall interception) (mm); and S is the so-called retention parameter (mm) deﬁned in Equation 9.10:SCN=−25 4100010 . (9.10)Where CN refers to the curve number, which is derived using lookup tables (see SCS 1986). The CN values vary according to soil type, land use, slope and changes in antecedent soil water con-tent. The actual number of the curve is represen-tative of the percentage of storm rainfall that runs off as stormﬂow, i.e. CN of 100 corresponds to all rainfall occurring as stormﬂow, such as for an impervious pavement (Figure 9.22).Empirical studies on small agricultural watersheds in the USA suggest that the initial abstraction term (Ia) can be approximated using Equation 9.11:Ia = 0.2S (9.11)This reduces Equation 6.9 to the form shown in Equation 9.12:QPSPS=−()+02082.. (9.12)200STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING
In the CN methodology antecedent, soil mois-ture condition is accounted for by having three different CNs, for dry, average and wet conditions.The CN method provides a simple solution to the problem of how to model the rainfall– runoff relationship. There are other methods to model the runoff from rainfall, e.g. the modiﬁed Green-Ampt inﬁltration method is frequently used in physically-based hydrological models to provide inﬁltration and surface runoff estimates. The simplicity provided by the CN method has many attractions but it does suffer from consequent drawbacks. The most notable of these for any analysis of land use change is that CN varies according to soil characteristics and land cover. A land use change from pasture (or subur-ban garden) to forest will lead to an alteration in three factors: the soil inﬁltration characteristics; the rainfall interception; and the antecedent soil moisture conditions. Therefore more than one fac-tor is likely to be altered in Equations 9.9–9.12 and a simple alteration of CN may not be enough to properly account for the land use change. To fully account for this type of land use change it is necessary to use a hydrological model that explic-itly accounts for antecedent soil moisture, soil inﬁltration characteristics and rainfall intercep-tion as distinct hydrological processes.The CN approach has been used extensively to make runoff predictions based on a time series of rainfall (Ponce and Hawkins 1996). It has also been incorporated into more sophisticated models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT; Cao et al. 2006). In this case the  rainfall–runoff relationship is derived from the CN approach and combined with other hydro-logical processes such as evaporation estimation and river ﬂow rates.Figure 9.22 Runoff curves for a range of rainfalls.
The term ‘conceptual’ is used because the equa-tions governing ﬂow rates are often deemed to be conceptually similar to the physical processes operating. So, for instance, the storage of water in a canopy or the soil may be thought of as simi-lar to storage within a bucket. As water enters the bucket it ﬁlls up until it overﬂows water at a rate equal to the entry rate. At the same time it is possible to have a ‘hole’ in the bucket that allows ﬂow out at a rate dependent on the level of water within the bucket (faster with more water). This is analogous to soil water or canopy ﬂow but is not a detailed description such as the Darcy–Richards approximation or the Rutter model. The rate of ﬂow through the catchment, and hence the estimated streamﬂow, is controlled by a series of Lumped conceptual modelsLumped conceptual models were the ﬁrst attempt to reproduce the different hydrological processes within a catchment in a numerical form. Rain-fall is added to the catchment and a water budget approach used to track the losses (e.g. evaporation) and movements of water (e.g. to and from soil water storage) within the catchment area. There are many examples in the literature of lumped conceptual models used to predict streamﬂows (e.g. Brandt et al. 1988).The term ‘lumped’ is used because all of the pro-cesses operate at one spatial scale – that is, they are lumped together and there is no spatial discre-tisation. The scale chosen is often a catchment or sometimes sub-catchments.STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING201or models used are solved for individual points within a catchment, using a grid pattern.The principle behind this type of model is that it is totally transparent; all processes operating within a catchment are simulated as a series of physically-based equations at points distributed throughout the catchment. By ‘physically-based’ we mean that as far as possible the physics of the processes is being represented (rather than by empirical equations). In theory this should mean that no calibration of the model is required and spatially distributed model output for any parameter can be obtained. In reality this is far from the case. There are numerous problems associated with using a physically based, dis-tributed model, as outlined by Beven (1989), Grayson et al. (1992) and others. The principal problem is that the amount of data required to set the initial conditions and parameterise the model is vast. The idea of obtaining saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements for every grid point in a catchment is impossible, let alone all the other parameters required. The lack of data to run the model leads to spatial averaging of parameters. There are also concerns with the size of grid used in applications (sometimes up to 1 km2) and whether it is feasible to use the governing equations at this scale. These types of problems led Beven (1989) to query whether there really is such a thing as physically based distributed hydrological models or whether they are really just lumped conceptual models with fancier equations.The concept of physically based distributed hydrological modelling is noble, but in reality the models have not produced the results that might have been expected. They are certainly unwieldy to use and have many simpliﬁcations that make the terminology doubtful. However they have been useful for gaining a greater understanding of our knowledge base in hydrological processes. The approach taken, with its lack of reliance on cali-bration, still offers the only way of investigating issues of land use change and predicting ﬂows in ungauged catchments.parameters that need to be calibrated for a given catchment. Calibration is normally carried out by comparing predicted ﬂows to measured values and adjusting (or ‘optimising’) the parameters until the best ﬁt is obtained. There is considerable debate on this technique as it may sometimes be possible to obtain a similar predicted hydrograph using a completely different set of optimised parameters. It is certainly true that the optimised parameters cannot be treated as having any physical meaning and should not be transferred to catchments other than those used for calibration.Lumped conceptual models offer a method of formulating the hydrological cycle into a water budget model that allows simulation of streamﬂow while also being able to ‘see’ the individual pro-cesses operating. This is an advance beyond black box modelling, but because the processes are rep-resented conceptually they are sometimes referred to as grey box models (i.e. you can see partially into them). They are also referred to as parametric models.Physically based distributed modelsThe rapid advances in computing power that have occurred since the 1970s mean that numeri-cal modelling has become much easier. Freeze and Harlan (1969) were the ﬁrst to formulate the idea of a numerical model that operates as a series of dif-ferential equations in a spatially distributed sense, an idea that prior to computers was unworkable. Their ideas (with some modiﬁcations from more recent research) were put into practice by several different organisations to make a physically based distributed hydrological model. Perhaps the best known of these is the Système Hydrologique Euro-péen (SHE) model, built by a consortium of French, Danish and British organisations during the 1970s and early 1980s (Abbott et al. 1986). A model such as the SHE uses many of the process estima-tion techniques described in earlier chapters (e.g. Darcy’s law for subsurface ﬂow, Rutter’s model for canopy interception, snow melt routines, etc.) in a water budgeting framework. Each of the equations 202STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLINGstress on the current river ecology. Consequently a branch of science has been developed that combines knowledge of river hydraulics with aquatic ecology to provide this information. This is described in the following section. The discussion is continued further in Chapter 11 where there is a description of water allocation methodology.Jowett (1997) divides the methodology used for instream ﬂow assessment into three types with an increasing complexity: historic ﬂow, hydrau-lic and habitat methods. The historic approach sets water abstraction limits based on a historical ﬂow range; the hydraulic method uses the relationship between hydraulic parameters (e.g. wetted perim-eter, stream depth, etc.) and stream health; and the habitat method uses actual measurements of stream health with changes in ﬂow regime to predict the impacts of ﬂow changes. The way these methods treat the relationship between increased streamﬂow and the biological response is shown in Figure 9.23. The historic method assumes that there is a linear relationship so that more ﬂow results in a greater biological response. The hydraulic method recog-nises that stream beds are non-linear in form and therefore a small change in ﬂow may result in large increases in biological productivity but that this decreases as the ﬂow increases. The habitat method recognises that there is a maxima in the biological productivity and high ﬂows may lead to decreasing biological response.Hydrological modelling for speciﬁc needsIn many cases where streamﬂow needs to be esti-mated, the use of a physically based model is akin to using the proverbial ‘sledgehammer to crack a walnut’. With the continuing increase in computing power there are numerous tools available to the hydrologist to build their own computer model to simulate a particular situ-ation of interest. These tools range from Geo-graphic Information Systems (GIS) with attached dynamic modelling languages to object-oriented languages that can use icon-linked modelling approaches (e.g. McKim et al. 1993). This per-haps offers a future role for hydrological mod-elling away from the large modelling packages such as SHE. In essence it allows the hydrolo-gist to simulate streamﬂow based on a detailed knowledge of catchment processes of importance for the particular region of interest.FLOW ASSESSMENT FOR STREAM ECOLOGYManagers of river systems frequently need infor-mation on the amount of ﬂow required to sustain the current river ecology. This is in order to ascer-tain how much water is available for out of stream usage (e.g. irrigation) without placing detrimental Case studyWATYIELD – MODELLING CHANGES IN WATER YIELD FROM ALTERING LAND COVER CHANGEThe degree of vegetation cover in a catchment will affect the amount of water flowing down a stream. The physical processes that cause this effect have been described in Chapter 3 and the impacts of this change are discussed in Chapter 11. A water balance model has been developed to quantify the impact of land use changes on the stream discharge. The model is simple to use and can be downloaded for free from the World Wide Web (look for WATYIELD at http://icm.landcare research.co.nz). Also available at this site are a series of reports that help parameterise the model and a full user’s guide.STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING203The WATYIELD model was developed for New Zealand conditions and works best in a humid temperate environment. It has been designed for catchments up to around 50 km2 in size. In the modelling terminology outlined earlier in this chapter, WATYIELD could be described as a lumped, conceptual model. However, there is detailed process representation of rainfall intercep-tion and soil moisture storage within the model so it moves slightly towards being physically based. The spatial representation is at the catch-ment scale; although it is possible to split a catch-ment into sub-sections with different vegetation covers and rainfall distributions. However, these sub-sections have no spatial differentiation within the catchment, i.e. the model doesn’t know where they are within a catchment, just that there are subsections. For catchments larger than 50 km2 the underlying assumptions of spatial uniformity start to break down and it is necessary to start introducing elements such as ﬂow routing down a stream (presently ignored at the daily time step of WATYIELD).WATYIELD works by adding daily rainfall to two storage terms which release water to a river based on hydrograph recession coefﬁcients (a full description of the model can be found in Fahey et al. 2004). The storage terms represent soil moisture and a deeper groundwater store. Daily rainfall is processed by the model so that any interception loss from a vegetation canopy is removed and all the resultant rainfall inﬁltrates into the soil mois-ture store. In order to operate the model a daily rainfall record, potential evapotranspiration, soil parameters and knowledge about ﬂow characteris-tics from a nearby stream are required. Much of this type of data is readily available from the scientiﬁc literature and resource management databases.WATYIELD has been applied to a 23 km2 catchment (Rocky Gully) in the South Island of New Zealand to investigate two possible land use change scenarios. The current vegetation cover for the catchment is a mixture of tall tussock grassland, pasture grasses and a small amount of scrubland forest. The catchment has an altitude range from 580 m to 1,350 m with an increasing rainfall with altitude.In testing the model against daily streamﬂow from 1989–2001, WATYIELD was able to pre-dict mean annual ﬂow within 2 per cent accuracy and mean annual 7-day low ﬂow within 3 per cent. The two scenarios simulated were:• 40 per cent of the catchment was converted to plantation forestry (Pinus radiata). All the planting occurred in the lower half of the catchment;• 50 per cent of the catchment was converted from tussock to pasture grassland. All the tus-sock grassland in the upper half of the catch-ment was replaced with pasture species.Each of these is a realistic land use change sce-nario for the region; conversion of pasture land to forestry is common practice, as is ‘improving’ grassland by over-sowing with rye grass species. The land use change scenarios were simulated in the model using the 1989–2001 rainfall data (i.e. repeating the earlier simulation but with a differ-ent land cover).The results from the modelling are shown in Table 9.6. An initial look at the results suggests a surprising result: the amount of interception loss from a 40 per cent increase in forestry does not transfer through into much of a change in mean annual streamﬂow or low ﬂows. There is a larger change in ﬂow regime from the replacement of tussock grassland in the upper catchment; despite this land use change resulting in a lowering of interception loss (tussock grassland has higher interception losses than pasture grass). The rea-son for these results is that it is the upper part of the catchment, with a higher rainfall, that pro-duces most of the streamﬂow, particularly the low ﬂows. Hence a change in land use in the lower section makes a relatively small change in the ﬂow regime. However, a change in land use in the upper region of the catchment has a larger effect 204STREAMFLOW ANALYSIS AND MODELLING
because this is where the effective rainfall is occur-ring. A change from tussock to pasture grassland increases the transpiration loss which more than offsets the decrease in canopy interception.In this case WATYIELD was able to tease out the difference between canopy interception and canopy transpiration. The difference between the two is what made the most difference in the simu-lations. The ﬁnal scenario modelled was to place the forestry in the upper reaches of the catchment; this reduced ﬂows by around 25 per cent. However this is a highly unlikely land use change scenario as commercial forestry at this latitude does not normally extend beyond 850 m above sea level.Table 9.6 Results from WATYIELD modelling of land use changeFlow measureScenario 1 (forestry in lower half replaces pasture)Scenario 2 (replacement of tussock grassland with pasture)Mean annual ﬂowReduced by 6%Reduced by 7%Mean annual 7-day low ﬂowReduced by 3%Reduced by 7%
The most well-known of the historic ﬂow methods is ‘Montana method’ proposed by Tennant (1976), also called the Tennant method. Tennant (1976) used hydraulic data from 11 streams in the USA and knowledge about depths and velocities required to sustain aquatic life to suggest that 10 per cent of average ﬂow is the lower limit for aquatic life. Tennant (1976) also recommended that 30 per cent of average ﬂow provides a satisfactory stream envi-ronment. With relatively easily derived ﬂow infor-mation (i.e. average ﬂow) a new ﬂow regime can be set for a river that takes into account the instream values. However this approach precludes the pos-sibility that a stream could be enhanced by a non-natural ﬂow regime. This is especially true where there is an upstream reservoir, in which case ﬂows can be manipulated to improve the aquatic environ-ment, not just maintain what is presently there.The hydraulic method requires measurements of hydraulic data such as wetted perimeter, width, velocity and depth at a series of cross sections. Then, using either rating curves (i.e. the stage–discharge relationship described in Chapter 8) or an equation such as Manning’s (see Chapter 8), the variations in a hydraulic parameter with ﬂow can be derived. The most commonly used hydraulic parameter is the wetted perimeter because it takes into account the area of streambed where periphyton and invertebrates live. A healthy periphyton and inver-tebrate community generally leads to a healthy river ecosystem. The variation in wetted perimeter with ﬂow is drawn in the same way as represented by the broken line in Figure 9.23. The minimum ﬂow for river is normally deﬁned by where the hydraulic parameter (e.g. wetted perimeter) starts to decline sharply to zero. The hydraulic method has the advantage over the historic method that it

9,"This chapter identiﬁes the different types of pol-lutants that can be found in aquatic environments and describes their major sources, especially where elevated levels may be found and what impact their presence has on aquatic ecology. The chapter also outlines the methods used to measure water qual-ity parameters. This is followed by a description of the management techniques used to control water quality in a river catchment.Traditionally, hydrology has been interested purely in the amount of water in a particular area: water quantity. This is frequently referred to as physical hydrology. If, however, we take a wider remit for hydrology – to include the availability of water for human consumption – then issues of water quality are of equal importance to quantity. There are three strong arguments as to why hydrol-ogy should consider water quality an area worthy of study.1 The interlink between water quality and quantity. Many water quality issues are directly linked to the amount of water available for dilution and dispersion of pollutants, whether they be natural or anthropogenic in source. It is virtually impossible to study one without the other. An example of this is shown in the Case Study of the River Thames through London (pp. 209–211).2 The interlink between hydrological processes and water quality. The method by which pollutants trans-fer from the land into the aquatic environment LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of water quality as an issue in hydrology and how it ties into water quantity. /H17039A knowledge of the main parameters used to assess water quality and what affects their levels in waterbodies. /H17039A knowledge of the measurement techniques and sampling methodology for assessing water quality. /H17039A knowledge of techniques used to control water pollution and manage water quality.10WATER QUALITY208WATER QUALITYi.e. minimising sedimentation in the dam (Kim et al. 2007).Spatial variations in water quality may be inﬂu-enced by many different environmental factors (e.g. climate, geology, weathering processes, vegetation cover and anthropogenic inﬂuences). Often it is a combination of these factors that makes a particu-lar water quality issue salient for a particular area. An example of this is acid rain (also discussed in Chapter 2) as a particular problem for north- eastern North America and Scandinavia. The sources of the acid rain are fossil fuel burning power stations and industry. It becomes a particular problem in these areas for a number of reasons: it is close to the sources of acid rain; high rainfall contributes a lot of acid to the soil; the soils are thin after extensive glaciation and derived from very old rocks; and the soils are heavily leached (have had a lot of water passing through them over a long time period) and have a low buffering capacity (see p. 47). This  combination of inﬂuences means that the water in the rivers has a low pH, and – of particular concern to gill-bearing aquatic fauna – has a high dissolved aluminium content because acidic water leaches aluminum out of the soil.is intrinsically linked with the hydrological pathway (i.e. the route by which the water moves from precipitation into a stream), and hence the hydrological processes occurring. A good example of this is in Heppell et al. (1999) where the mechanisms of herbicide transport from ﬁeld to stream are linked to runoff path-ways in a clay catchment.3 Employment of hydrologists. It is rare for someone employed in water resource management to be entirely concerned with water quantity, with no regard for quality issues. The maintenance of water quality is not just for drinking water (traditionally an engineer’s role) but at a wider scale can be for maintaining the amenity value of rivers and streams.It is easy to think of water quality purely in terms of pollution; i.e. waste substances entering a river system as a result of human activity. This is an important issue in water quality analysis but is by no means the only one. One of the largest water quality issues is the amount of suspended sediment in a river, which is frequently a com-pletely natural process. Suspended sediment has severe implications for the drinking water quality of a river, but also for other hydrological concerns such as ecological impacts and implications for reservoir design. As soon as a river is dammed the water velocity will slow down. Simple knowledge of the Hjulstrom curve (see Figure 10.1) tells us that this will result in the deposition of suspended sediment. That deposition will eventually reduce the capacity of the reservoir held behind the dam. In high-energy river systems, for even a very large reservoir, a dramatic reduction in capacity can take place within two to four decades. It is critically important for a hydrologist involved in reservoir design to have some feeling for the quantities of suspended sediment so that the lifespan of a res-ervoir can be calculated. In South Korea, reservoir management includes understanding the sediment plume entering a reservoir during the rainy season and using a multiple level abstraction to release this sediment laden water during the wet season, Figure 10.1 The Hjulstrom curve relating stream velocity to the erosion/deposition characteristics for dif-ferent sized particles (x-axis). In general, the slower the water moves, the ﬁner the particles that are deposited, and the faster the water moves the larger the particles being transported.
WATER QUALITY209place huge pressures on the river systems as repos-itories of waste products. It is also important to study these issues because they are something that humans can have some control over, unlike many natural water-quality issues.Having argued for the role of natural water- quality issues to be considered seriously, the reader will ﬁnd that the majority of this chapter deals with human-induced water-quality issues. This is an inevitable response to the world we live in where we Case studyTHE RIVER THAMES THROUGH LONDON:  WATER QUALITY CHANGEThe River Thames as it ﬂows through London is one of the great tourist sights of Europe. It is an integral part of London, not just for its sce-nic attraction but also as a transport route right into the heart of a modern thriving city. The river also has a large part to play in London’s water resources, both as a source of drinking water and a disposal site for waste.London has a long history of water-quality problems on the Thames, but it has not always been so. Prior to the nineteenth century, domes-tic waste from London was collected in cesspools and then used as fertiliser on agricultural land (hence the use of the term ‘sewage farm’ for sew-age treatment stations). The Thames maintained a ﬁsh population, and salmon from the river were sold for general consumption. With the intro-duction of compulsory water closets (i.e. ﬂush-ing toilets) in 1843 and the rise in factory waste during the Industrial Revolution, things started to change dramatically for the worse during the nineteenth century. The majority of London’s waste went through poorly constructed sewers (often leaking into shallow aquifers which sup-plied drinking water) straight into the Thames without any form of treatment. In 1854 there was an outbreak of cholera in London that resulted in up to 10,000 deaths. In a famous epidemiological study Dr John Snow was able to link the cholera to sewage pollution in water drawn from shallow aquifers. The culmination of this was ‘the year of the great stink’ in 1856. The smell of untreated waste in the Thames was so bad that disinfected sheets had to be hung from windows in the Houses of Parliament to lessen discomfort for the lawmakers of the day. In the best NIMBY (‘not in my back yard’) tradition this spurred parliament into action and in the following decade, radical changes were made to the way that London used the River Thames. Water abstraction for drinking was only permitted upstream of tidal limits and London’s sewage was piped downstream to Beck-ton where it was discharged (still untreated) into the Thames on an ebb tide.The result of these reforms was a radical improvement of the river water quality through central London; but there was still a major prob-lem downstream of Beckton. The improvements were not to last, however, as by the middle of the twentieth century the Thames was effectively a dead river (i.e. sustained no ﬁsh population and had a dissolved oxygen concentration of zero for long periods during the summer). This was the result of several factors: a rapidly increasing population, increasing industrialisation, a lack of investment in sewage treatment and bomb dam-age during the Second World War.Since the 1950s the Thames has been steadily improving. Now there is a resident ﬁsh population and migratory salmon can move up the Thames. This improvement has been achieved through an upgrading of the many sewage treatment works that discharge into the Thames and its tributaries. The Environment Agency (the statutory authority 210WATER QUALITYresponsible for rivers in England) has much to do with the management of the lower Thames and proudly proclaims that the Thames ‘is one of the cleanest metropolitan rivers in the world’. How realistic is this claim?There is no doubt that the Thames has been transformed remarkably from the ‘dead’ river of 60 years ago into something far cleaner, but there are two problems remaining for the management of the Thames through London, and for one of these nothing can be done.• The Thames is a relatively small river that does not have the ﬂushing potential of other large rivers; therefore it cannot cleanse itself very easily.• The sewer network underneath London has not been designed for a large modern city and cannot cope with the strains put on it.At Westminster (in front of the Houses of Par-liament) the Thames is over 300 m wide; this is conﬁned from the width of 800 m evident during Roman times. This great width belies a relatively small ﬂow of fresh water. It appears much larger than in reality because of its use for navigation and the tidal inﬂuence. The average ﬂow rate for the Thames is 53 cumecs, rising to 130 cumecs under high ﬂows. In Table 10.1 this is compared with rivers that ﬂow through other major cities. In Seoul, a similarly sized capital city, the Han River is over seven times larger than the Thames. The effect of the small ﬂow in the Thames is that it does not have great ﬂushing power. During the summer months it may take a body of water three months to move from west London to the open sea. On each tide it may move up to 14 km in total but this results in less than a kilometre movement downstream. If this body of water is polluted in some way then it is not receiving much dilution or dispersion during the long trip through London.The second important factor is the poor state of London’s sewers. Prior to Sir Joseph Bazal-gette’s sewer network of 1864 the old tributar-ies of the Thames acted as sewers, taking waste water directly to the Thames. Bazalgette’s grand sewerage scheme intercepted these rivers and transported the sewage through a large pipe to east London. This system still exists today. The actual sewerage network is very well built and still works effectively. The problem is that it is unable to cope with the volume of waste expected to travel through it, particularly when it rains, as it is a combined stormwater–sewage network. The original tributaries of the Thames, such as the Fleet, still exist under London and any storm run-off is channelled into them. When the volume of stormwater and sewage is too great for the sewers, the rivers act as overspills and take the untreated sewage directly into the Thames. This is a par-ticular problem during summer storms when the volume of water ﬂowing down the Thames is low and cannot dilute the waste effectively.

These boats can ﬂoat with a body of sewage-polluted water, injecting oxygen so that the dissolved oxygen level does not reach levels that would be harm-ful to ﬁsh and other aquatic creatures. To help in the tracking of a polluted body of water there are water-quality monitoring stations attached to bridges over the Thames. These stations measure temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and electrical conductivity at 15-minute intervals and are monitored by the Environment Agency as they are received in real time at the London ofﬁce.In addition to the oxygen-injecting boats, there is tight water-quality management for the River Thames through London. This is operated by the Thames Estuary Partnership (http:// thamesestuarypartnership.org), a group of interested bodies including the Environment Agency. Their remit includes other factors such as protecting London from ﬂooding (using the Thames Barrier), but also setting higher efﬂuent standards for sewage treatment works during the summer. The emphasis is on ﬂexibility in their management of the Thames. In 2016, construction started on the Thames Tideway Tunnel – a 25 km interception, storage and transfer tunnel running below the Thames which will take waste from Lon-don to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works. This major upgrade of London’s sewerage system will signiﬁcantly reduce overﬂows of untreated sewer-age into the river Thames. There is no question that the River Thames has improved from 50 years ago. In many respects it is a river transformed, but it still has major water-quality problems such as you would expect to ﬁnd where a small river is the receptacle for the treated waste of over 10 mil-lion people. The water-quality management of a river like the Thames needs consideration of many facets of hydrology: understanding pollutants, knowledge of stormﬂow peaks from large rainfall events, and streamﬂow statistics.Before looking at the water-quality issues of sub-stances within a river system it is worth consider-ing how they reach water bodies. In studying water pollution it is traditional to differentiate between point source and diffuse pollutants. As the terminol-ogy suggests, point sources are discrete places in space (e.g. a sewage treatment works) where pol-lutants originate. Diffuse sources are spread over a much greater land area and the exact locations can-not be speciﬁed. Examples of diffuse pollution are excess fertilisers and pesticides from agricultural production. The splitting of pollutants into diffuse and point sources has some merit for designing pre-ventative strategies but like most categorisations there are considerable overlaps. Although a sew-age treatment works can be thought of as a point source when it discharges efﬂuent into a stream, it has actually gathered its sewage from a large dif-fuse area. If there is a particular problem with a sewage treatment works efﬂuent, it may be a result of accumulated diffuse source pollution rather than the actual sewage treatment works itself.A more useful categorisation of water pollutants is to look at their impacts on the river system. In this way we can differentiate between three major types of pollutants.• Toxic compounds, which cause damage to biologi-cal activity in the aquatic environment.• Oxygen balance affecting compounds, which either consume oxygen or inhibit the transfer of oxy-gen between air and water. This would also include thermal pollution as warm water does not hold as much dissolved oxygen as cold water (see pp. 215–216).• Suspended solids – inert solid particles suspended in the water.Whether we approve or not, rivers are receptacles for large amounts of waste produced by humans. Frequently this is deliberate and is due to the abil-ity of rivers to cope with waste through degrada-tion, dilution and dispersion. Just how quickly these three processes operate is dependent on the 212WATER QUALITYcurve, especially the distance downstream until recovery, is highly dependent on the ﬂow regime of the receiving river. A fast ﬂowing, readily oxygen-ated stream will recover much faster than a slow-moving river. Large rivers will have a faster recovery time (and the depth of sag will be less) than small streams, due to the amount of dilution occurring.WATER-QUALITY PARAMETERSTo analyse the water quality within a river, consid-eration has to be given to what type of test may be carried out and the sampling pattern to be used. There are numerous parameters that can be mea-sured, and each is important for the part they play in an overall water-quality story. It is not necessary to measure them all for a single water-quality anal-ysis study; instead the relevant parameters for a par-ticular study should be identiﬁed. This can be done using a priori knowledge of the water- quality issues being studied. To aid in this, different parameters are discussed here with respect to their source; what type of levels might be expected in natural rivers; and the impact they have on a river ecosystem. However, a critical point to remember about any kind of water quality measurement is that it is just a ‘snap shot’ in time; water quality parameters can vary markedly over time.The ﬁrst distinction that can be made is between physical and chemical parameters. With chemical parameters it is the concentration of a particular chemical substance that is being assessed. With physical parameters it is a physical measurement being made, normally measuring the amount of something within a water sample.Physical parametersTemperatureThe temperature of water in a river is an important  consideration for several reasons. The most impor-tant feature of temperature is the interdependence it has with dissolved oxygen content (see pp. 215–216). Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than pollutant load already present in the river, the tem-perature and pH of the water, the amount of water ﬂowing down the river and the mixing potential of the river. The last two of these are river ﬂow charac-teristics that will in turn be inﬂuenced by the time of year, the nature of ﬂow in the river (e.g. the shape of the ﬂow duration curve), and the velocity and turbulence of ﬂow. This demonstrates the strong interrelationship that exists between water quality and water quantity in a river system.One remarkable feature about rivers is that given enough time and a reasonable pollution loading, rivers will recover from the input of many pol-lutant types. That is not to say that considerable harm cannot be done through water pollution incidents, but by and large the river system will recover so long as the pollution loading is tempo-rary. An example of this can be seen in the oxygen sag curve (see Figure 10.2) that is commonly seen below point sources of organic pollution (e.g. sew-age efﬂuent). The curve shows that upon entering the river there is an instant drop in dissolved oxy-gen content. This is caused by bacteria and other micro-organisms in the river feeding on the organic matter in the stream and using any available dis-solved oxygen. This would have a severe impact on any aquatic fauna unable to move away from this zone of low dissolved oxygen. As the pollutant load moves downstream the degradation, dilution and dispersal starts to take effect and oxygen lev-els start to recover in the river. The shape of the

WATER QUALITY213to the concentration of dissolved ions. Pure, dis-tilled water will still conduct electricity but the more dissolved ions in water the higher its electri-cal conductivity. This means that there is a linear relationship between TDS and conductivity which can be derived (Equation 10.1).K=ConductivityTDSorTDSConductivity=K (10.1)This relationship gives a very good surrogate measure for TDS. The K term is a constant (usu-ally between 0.55 and 0.75) that can be estimated by taking several measurements of conductivity with differing TDS levels. Conductivity is a sim-ple measurement to take as there are many robust ﬁeld instruments that will give an instant read-ing. This can then be related to the TDS level at a later stage. Electrical conductivity is measured in Siemens per metre, although the usual expres-sion is microsiemens per centimetre (µS/cm). Riv-ers normally have a conductivity between 10 and 1,000 µS/cm.Suspended solidsThe amount of suspended solids has been high-lighted at the start of this chapter as a key mea-sure of water quality. The carrying of suspended sediment in a river is part of the natural erosion and sediment transport process. The sediment will be deposited at any stage when the river velocity drops and conversely it will be picked up again with higher river velocities (see Figure 10.1). In this manner the total suspended solids (TSS) load will vary in space and time. The amount of TSS in a river will affect the aquatic fauna, because it is dif-ﬁcult for egg-laying ﬁsh and invertebrates to breed in an environment of high sediment. Many species of ﬁsh, for example, need clean, well-oxygenated gravels in which to spawn. Suspended sediment is frequently inert, as in the case of most clay and silt particles, but it can be organic in content and there-fore have an oxygen demand.TSS is expressed in mg/l for a water sample but fre-quently uses other units when describing sediment colder water. The dissolved oxygen content is criti-cal in allowing aquatic fauna to respire, so temper-ature is also indirectly important in this manner. Water temperature is also a controlling factor in the rate of chemical reactions occurring within a river. Warm water will increase the rate of many chemical reactions occurring in a river, and it is able to dis-solve more substances. This is due to a weakening of the hydrogen bonds and a greater ability of the bipolar molecules to surround anions and cations.Warm water may enter a river as thermal pol-lution from power stations and other industrial processes. In many power stations (gas, coal and nuclear) water is used as a coolant in addition to the generation of steam to drive turbines. Because of this, power stations are frequently located near a river or lake to provide the water source. It is normal for the power stations to have procedures in place so that hot water is not discharged directly into a river; however, despite the cooling processes used, the water is frequently 1–2 °C warmer on dis-charge. The impact that this has on a river system will be dependent on the river size (i.e. degree of dilution and rate of dispersion).Dissolved solidsIn the ﬁrst chapter, the remarkable ability of water to act as a solvent was described. As water passes through a soil column or over a soil surface it will dissolve many substances attached to the soil par-ticles. Equally water will dissolve particles from the air as it passes through the atmosphere as rain. The amount of dissolved substances in a water sample is referred to as the total dissolved solids (TDS). The higher the level of TDS the more contaminated a water body may be, whether that be from natural or anthropogenic sources. Meybeck (1981) estimates that the global average TDS load in rivers is around 100 mg/l, but it may rise considerably higher (e.g. the Colorado River has an average TDS of 703 mg/l).Electrical conductivityThe ability of a water sample to transmit electrical current (its conductivity) is directly proportional 214WATER QUALITYturbidity are directly related. Turbidity is measured as the amount of light scattered by the suspended particles in the water. A beam of light of known luminosity is shone through a sample and the amount reaching the other side is measured. This is compared to a standard solution of formazin. The units for turbidity are either FTU (formazin tur-bidity units) or NTU (normalised turbidity units); they are identical. Turbidity is a critical measure of water quality for the same reasons as TSS. It is a simpler measurement to make, especially in the ﬁeld, and therefore it is sometimes used as a sur-rogate for TSS.Chemical parameterspHChemists think of water as naturally disassociating into two separate ions: the hydroxide (OH–) and hydrogen (H+) ions.H2O   OH– + H+The acidity of water is given by the hydrogen ion, and hence pH (the measure of acidity) is a mea-sure of the concentration of hydrogen ions present. In fact it is the log of the inverse concentration of hydrogen ions (Equation 10.2).PH=⎡⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥+log1H (10.2)This works out on a scale between 1 and 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH value less than 7 indicates an acid solution; greater than 7 a basic solution (also called alkaline). It is important to bear in mind that because the pH scale is logarithmic (base 10) a solu-tion with pH value 5 is ten times as acidic as one with pH value 6.In natural waters the pH level may vary consider-ably. Rainwater will naturally have a pH value less than 7, due to the absorption of gases such as carbon dioxide by the rainwater. This forms a weak carbonic acid, increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions ⥯load. Table 10.2 shows some values of sediment dis-charge (annual totals) and calculates an average TSS from the data. It is remarkable to see the data in this form, enabling contrast to be drawn between the different rivers. Although the Amazon delivers a huge amount of sediment to the oceans it has a rela-tively low average TSS, a reﬂection of the extremely high discharge. In contrast to this the Huanghe river (sometimes referred to as the Yellow river due to the high sediment load) is virtually a soup! It must be noted that these are average values over a year and that the TSS will vary considerably during an annual cycle (the TSS will rise considerably during a ﬂood).TurbidityTurbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of water. The cloudiness is caused by suspended solids and gas bubbles within the water sample, so TSS and Table 10.2 Sediment discharge, total river discharge (averaged over several years) and average total suspended solids (TSS) for selected large river systemsRiver (country)Sediment discharge (103 tonnes/yr)Discharge (km3/yr)Average TSS (mg/l)Zaïre (Zaïre)43,0001,2500.03Amazon (Brazil)900,0006,3000.14Danube (Romania)67,0002060.33Mississippi (USA)210,0005800.36Murray (Australia)30,000221.36Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh)1,670,0009711.72Huanghe or Yellow (China)1,080,0004922.04Source: Data from Milliman and Meade (1983)WATER QUALITY215in solution. The normal pH of rainfall is somewhere between 5 and 6 but may drop as low as 4, particu-larly if there is industrial air pollution nearby. For example, Zhao and Sun (1986) report a pH value of 4.02 in Guiyang city, China, during 1982.Acidic substances may also be absorbed easily as water passes through a soil column. A particular example of this is water derived from peat, which will absorb organic substances. These form organic acids, giving peat-derived water a brown tinge and a low pH value. At the other end of the spectrum rivers that drain carbonate-rich rocks (e.g. lime-stone and chalk), have a higher pH due to the dis-solved bicarbonate ions.The pH value of rivers is important for the aquatic fauna living within them. The acidity of a river is an important control for the amount of dis-solved ions present, particularly metal species. The more acidic a river is the more metallic ions will be held in solution. For ﬁsh it is often the level of dis-solved aluminium that is critical for their survival in low pH waters. The aluminium is derived from the breakdown of alumino-silicate minerals in clay, a process that is enhanced by acidic water. Water with a pH between 6 and 9 is unlikely to be harm-ful to ﬁsh. Once it drops below 6 it becomes harm-ful for breeding, and salmonid species (e.g. trout and salmon) cannot survive at a pH lower than 4. Equally a pH higher than 10 is toxic to most ﬁsh species (Alabaster and Lloyd 1980). Table 10.3 summarises the effect of decreasing pH (i.e. increas-ing acidity) on aquatic ecology.Mention needs to be made of the confusing terminology regarding alkalinity. Alkalinity is a measure of the capacity to absorb hydrogen ions without a change in pH (Viessman and Hammer 1998). This is inﬂuenced by the concentration of hydroxide, bicarbonate or carbonate ions. In water-quality analysis the term ‘alkalinity’ is used almost exclusively to refer to the concentration of bicar-bonate (HCO3–) ions because this is the most vari-able of the three. The bicarbonate ions are derived from the percolation of water through calcareous rocks (e.g. limestones or chalk). It is important to know their concentration for the buffering of pH Table 10.3 Effect of increasing acidity on aquatic ecologyEffect on organisms or processpH valueMayﬂies disappear6.5Phytoplankton species decline – green ﬁlamentous periphyton appears6Molluscs disappear5.5–6.0Waterfowl breeding declines5.5Bacterial decomposition slows/fungal decomposition appears5Salmonid reproduction fails – aluminium toxicity increases5Most amphibia disappear5Caddis ﬂies, stone ﬂies and Megaloptera (dobsonﬂies, alderﬂies, etc.) disappear4.5–5.0Beetles, dragonﬂies and damselﬂies disappear4.5Most adult ﬁsh harmed4.5Source: Dodds (2002), adapted from Jeffries and Mills (1990)and for issues of water hardness. The buffering capacity of soils, and water derived from soils, is an important concept in water quality. The buffering capacity of a solution is the ability to absorb acid without changing the pH. This is achieved through a high base cation load or high bicarbonate load. This is why soil derived from limestone and chalk has fewer problems coping with acid rain.Dissolved oxygenDissolved oxygen is vital to any aquatic fauna that use gills to breath. Salmonid species of ﬁsh require dissolved oxygen contents greater than 5 mg/l, whereas coarse ﬁsh (e.g. perch, pike) can survive in levels as low as 2 mg/l. The dissolved oxygen content is also an important factor in the way we taste water. Water saturated in oxygen tastes fresh to human palates; hence drinking water is almost 216WATER QUALITY
is the BOD5 value. Over an extended period the dissolved oxygen content of a polluted water sam-ple will look something like that shown in Fig-ure 10.4. In this case the dissolved oxygen content has dropped from 9.0 on day one to 3.6 on day ﬁve, giving a BOD5 value of 5.4 mg/l. After a long period of time (normally more than 5 days) oxygen will start to be consumed by nitrifying bacteria. In this case the bacteria will be consuming oxygen to turn nitrogenous compounds (e.g. ammonium ions) into nitrate. In order to be sure that nitrify-ing bacteria are not adding to the oxygen demand a suppressant (commonly allyl thiourea or ATU) is added. This ensures that all the oxygen demand is from the decomposition of organic matter. The use of a 5-day period is another safeguard, as, due to the slow growth of nitrifying bacteria, their effect is not noticeable until between 8 and 10 days (Teb-butt 1993). There is an argument to be made saying that it does not matter which bacteria are causing the oxygen demand, the test should be looking at all oxygen demand over a ﬁve-day period and therefore there is no need to add ATU. However the standard BOD test uses ATU to suppress the nitrifying bacteria.In some cases, particularly when dealing with waste water, the oxygen demand will be higher always oxygenated before being sent through a pipe network to consumers.There are two methods by which dissolved oxy-gen content is considered: percentage saturation and concentration (mg/l). These two measures are interrelated through temperature, as the dissolved oxygen content of water is highly temperature dependent (see Figure 10.3).Biochemical oxygen demandOne of the key water-quality parameters is the ﬁve-day biochemical oxygen demand test (sometimes referred to as the biological oxygen demand test, or BOD5). This is a measure of the oxygen required by bacteria and other micro-organisms to break down organic matter in a water sample. It is an indirect measure of the amount of organic matter in a water sample, and gives an indication of how much dissolved oxygen could be removed from water as the organic matter decays.The test is simple to perform and easily repli-cable. A sample of water needs to be taken, placed in a clean, darkened glass bottle and left to reach 20 °C. Once this has occurred the dissolved oxygen content should be measured (as a concentration). The sample should then be left at 20 °C for 5 days in a darkened environment. After this the dissolved oxygen content should be measured again.

WATER QUALITY2171993). Examples include benzene, chlorophenols, pesticides, trihalomethanes and poly-nuclear aro-matic hydrocarbons (PAH). These would normally be found in extremely low concentrations but do present signiﬁcant health risks over the long term. The data for pesticide concentrations (see Table 10.4) in European water resources show that it is a signiﬁcant problem. This indicates that all water extracted from surface water supplies in Bel-gium (supplies approximately 30 per cent of the Belgian population) will require pesticide removal before reticulation to customers (Eureau 2001). Although Germany appears to have no pesticide problem, 10 per cent of its surface water resources occasionally have pesticide levels greater than 0.1 µg/l and 90 per cent have pesticides in concen-trations less than 0.1 µg/l (but still present) (Eureau 2001).Some of the trace organic compounds accumu-late through the food chain so that humans and other species that eat large aquatic fauna may be at risk. Of particular concern are endocrine disrupt-ing chemicals (EDCs), which have been detected in many rivers. These chemicals, mostly a by-product of industrial processes, attack the endocrine system of humans and other mammals, affecting hormone levels. Some chemicals (e.g. DDT) have the ability to mimic the natural hormone oestrogen. Because oestrogen is part of the reproductive process these chemicals have the potential to affect reproductive than total saturation. In this case the sample needs to be diluted with distilled water. The maximum dissolved oxygen content at 20 °C is 9.1 mg/l, so any water sample with a BOD5 value higher than 9 will require dilution. After the diluted test a cal-culation needs to be performed to ﬁnd the actual oxygen demand. If you have diluted the sample by half then you need to double your measured BOD5 value, and so on.A normal unpolluted stream should have a BOD5 value of less than 5 mg/l. Untreated sewage is somewhere between 220 and 500 mg/l; while milk has a BOD5 value of 140,000 mg/l. From these values it is possible to see why a spillage of milk into a stream can have such detrimental effects on the aquatic fauna. The milk is not toxic in its own right, but bacteria consuming the milk will strip the water of any dissolved oxygen and therefore deprive ﬁsh of the opportunity to breathe.There are three reasons why BOD5 is such a cru-cial test for water quality:• Dissolved oxygen is critical to aquatic fauna and the ability to lose dissolved oxygen through organic matter decay is an important measure of stream health.• It is an indirect measure of the amount of organic matter in the water sample.• It is the most frequently measured water quality test and has become a standard measure; this means that there are plenty of data to compare readings against.It also important to realise that BOD is not a direct measure of pollution; rather, it measures the effects of pollution. It also should be borne in mind that there may be other substances present in your water sample that inhibit the natural bacteria (e.g. toxins). In this case the BOD5 reading may be low despite a high organic load.Trace organicsOver 600 organic compounds have been detected in river water, mostly from human activity (Tebbutt Table 10.4 Percentage of water resources with pesticide concentrations regularly greater than 0.1 µg/l (European Union drinking water stan-dard) for selected European countriesCountrySurface water (%)Groundwater (%)Belgium1005.2Denmarkn/a8.9Germany0.00.0Netherlands50.05.0UK77.06.0Source: Data from Eureau (2001)218WATER QUALITYcan be reversed, at least in the ﬁrst stage. In this case nitrates will turn into nitrite and oxygen will be released. Unfortunately, this is not a ready means for re-oxygenating a river as by the time the dissolved oxygen level has dropped to 1 mg/l the ﬁsh popula-tion will have died or moved elsewhere.The levels of nitrate in a water sample can be expressed in two different ways: absolute nitrate concentration, or the amount of nitrogen held as nitrate (normally denoted as NO3–N). The two are related by a constant value of approximately 4.4. As an example, the World Health Organisation recommended that the drinking water standard for nitrate in drinking water be 45 mg/l. This can also be expressed as 10 mg/l NO3–N.As indicated above, one source of nitrate is from treated sewage. A second source is from agricul-tural fertilisers. Farmers apply nitrate fertilisers to enhance plant growth, particularly during the spring. Plants require nitrogen to produce green leaves, and nitrates are the easiest form to apply as a fertiliser. This is because nitrates are extremely soluble and can easily be taken up by the plant through its root system. Unfortunately this high solubility makes them liable to be ﬂushed through the soil water system and into rivers. To make matters worse a popular fertiliser is ammonium nitrate – (NH4)2NO3. This has the added advantage for the farmer of three nitrogen atoms per molecule. It has the disadvantage for the freshwater environ-ment of extremely high solubility and providing ammonium ions in addition to nitrate. The applica-tion of nitrate fertilisers is most common in areas of intensive agricultural production such as arable and intensive livestock farming.Another source of nitrates in river systems is from animal wastes, particularly in dairy farming where slurry is applied to ﬁelds. This is organic nitrogen (frequently with high urea content from urine) which will break down to form nitrates. This is part of the nitriﬁcation process described earlier.A fourth source of nitrates in river systems is from plants that capture nitrogen gas from the air. This is not strictly true, as it is actually bacteria such as Rhizobium, attached to a plant’s root, that organs and even DNA. Studies have shown high levels of oestrogen-mimicking compounds in sew-age efﬂuent (Montagnani et al. 1996) and that male ﬁsh held in cages at sewage efﬂuent discharge sites can develop female sexual organs (Jobling and Sumpter 1993).Trace organics can be detected using gas chro-matography, although this is made difﬁcult by the sheer number of compounds to be detected. They are removed from drinking water supplies using activated carbon ﬁlters, or sometimes oxidation by ozone.Nitrogen compoundsNitrogen exists in the freshwater environment in four main forms:• organic nitrogen – proteins, amino acids and urea• ammonia – either as free ammonia (NH3) or the ammonium ion (NH4+)• nitrite (NO2–)• nitrate (NO32–).If organic nitrogen compounds enter a river (e.g. in untreated sewage) then an oxidation process called nitriﬁcation takes places. An approximation of the process is outlined below:Organic N + ONH/NHONO + ONO234222→+→→+−−32For this to occur there must be nitrifying bacteria and oxygen present. This is one of the main pro-cesses operating in a sewage treatment works (see  pp. 225–227) – the breakdown of organic nitrog-enous compounds into a stable and relatively harm-less nitrate. There are two problems with this process occurring in the natural river environment. First, there is the oxygen demand created by the nitriﬁ-cation process. Second, the intermediate ammonia stage is highly toxic, even in very low concentra-tions. Under extremely low dissolved oxygen con-centrations (less than 1 mg/l) the nitriﬁcation process WATER QUALITY219England; in different parts of the world the cycles will differ in timing and extent.Nitrates are relatively inert and do not create a major health concern. An exception to this is methaemoglobinaemina (‘blue baby syndrome’). Newborn babies do not have the bacteria in their stomach to deal with nitrates in the same man-ner as older children and adults. In the reducing surroundings of the stomach the nitrate is trans-formed into nitrite that then attaches itself to the haemoglobin molecule in red blood cells, preferen-tially replacing oxygen. This leads to a reduction in oxygen supply around the body, hence the name ‘blue baby syndrome’. In reality methaemoglobi-naemina is extremely rare, possibly coming from  nitrate-polluted well supplies but not mains- supplied drinking water. The drinking water limit for the European Union is 50 mg/l of nitrate (44 mg/l in the USA). In rivers it is rare to have nitrate values as high as this. In a study of streams draining intensively dairy-farmed land in the North Island of New Zealand, Rodda et al. (1999) report maximum nitrate levels of 26.4 mg/l. These are reported as being ‘very high by New Zealand standards’ (Rodda et al. 1999: 77). In Figure 10.5 the peak nitrate level for the river Lea in England is 21 mg/l, with the norm being somewhere between 5 and 10 mg/l.capture the gaseous nitrogen and turn it into water-soluble forms for the plants to use. Not all plants have this ability; in agriculture it is the legumes, such as clovers, lucerne (or alfalfa), peas and soy beans, that can gain nitrogen in this way. Once the nitrogen is in a soluble form it can leach through to a river system in the same way that fertilisers do. Over a summer period the nitrogen levels in a soil build up and then are washed out when autumn and winter rains arrive. This effect is exacerbated by ploughing in the autumn, which releases large amounts of soil-bound nitrogen.There is one other source of nitrates in rivers: atmospheric pollution. Nitrogen gas (the largest constituent of the atmosphere) will combine with oxygen whenever there is enough energy for it to do so. This energy is readily supplied by combus-tion engines (cars, trucks, industry, etc.) producing various forms of nitrogen oxide gases (often referred to as NOx gases). These gases are soluble to water in the atmosphere and form nitrites and nitrates in rainwater. This is not a well-studied area and it is difﬁcult to quantify how much nitrogen reaches rivers from this source (see p. 47).The different sources of nitrate in a river add together to give a cycle of levels to be expected in a year. Figure 10.5 shows this cycle over a 3-year period on the river Lea, south-east England. The low points of nitrate levels correspond to the end of a summer period, with distinct peaks being vis-ible over the autumn to spring period, particularly in the spring. The Lea is a river that has intensive arable agriculture in its upper reaches, but also a signiﬁcant input from sewage efﬂuent. At times during the summer months the Lea can consist of completely recycled water, and the water may have been through more than one sewage works. This gives a background nitrate level, but it is perhaps surprising that the summer levels of nitrate are not higher, compared to the winter period. Partly this can be attributed to the growth of aquatic plants in the summer, which remove nitrate from the water. The peaks over the autumn–spring period are as a result of agricultural practices discussed above. The example given here is speciﬁc to the south-east of 
Figure 10.5 Nitrate levels in the river Lea, England. Three years of records are shown: from September 1979 until September 1982.Source: Data from the Environment Agency220WATER QUALITYwater. It is used because it is toxic to bacteria and relatively short lived. More common to ﬁnd in river water samples is the chloride ion. This may be an indicator of sewage pollution as there is a high chlo-ride content in urine. Chloride ions give the brack-ish taste of sea water, the threshold for taste being around 300 mg/l. The European Commission limit for drinking water is 200 mg/l.Heavy metals‘Heavy metals’ is the term applied to metals with an atomic weight greater than 6. They are gen-erally only found in very low levels dissolved in fresh water, but may be found in bed load sedi-ments. In acidic waters metals can be dissolved (i.e. found in ionic form). They are often toxic in concentrations above trace levels. The toxicity, in decreasing order, is mercury, cadmium, cop-per, zinc, nickel, lead, chromium, aluminium and cobalt (Gray 1999). In the aquatic environment, copper and zinc are the most frequent causes of toxicity. A major source of zinc is derived from galvanised steel, particularly in wire fencing and roofs (Alloway and Ayres 1997).Accumulation of lead in sediments has been a problem for aquatic wildlife. Since the banning of leaded petrol, the major source has been through the use of lead shot and ﬁshing sinkers. Lead shot has been banned in favour of steel shot in many countries (e.g. USA, UK, New Zealand, Australia) due to these problems (Dodds 2002).The sources of heavy metals in the aquatic envi-ronment are almost always industrial or surface runoff from roads. Sewage sludge (the product of sedimentation at a sewage treatment works) is fre-quently heavy metal-rich, derived from industry discharging waste into the sewerage system. When untreated sewage is discharged into a river, heavy metals can be found in the sediments. Where there is a combined sewage and stormwater drainage sys-tem for an urban area, untreated sewage can be dis-charged during a storm event when the sewage treatment works cannot cope with the extra storm water. Runoff from roads (through a stormwater The biggest concern with nitrates in a river sys-tem is eutrophication. In exactly the same way that the nitrogen enhances the growth of land-based plants, it will also boost the growth of aquatic plants, including algae. This creates a problem of over-production of plant matter in river systems. This is discussed in more detail on pp. 224–225.PhosphatesPhosphorus can be found in three different forms: orthophosphate, polyphosphate (both normally dis-solved) and organic phosphate (bound to organic par-ticles). The ratio of different forms of phosphorus in a water sample is highly pH dependent (Chapman 1996). Like nitrogen, the availability of phosphorus is a limiting factor in plant growth. The most com-mon form of application for plants is as phosphate. The major difference from nitrates is that phosphate is not nearly as soluble. Consequently phosphate is normally applied as a solid fertiliser, and less fre-quently than nitrate. In river systems the main source of dissolved phosphate is from detergents and soaps that come through sewage treatment works. Sewage treatment works remove very little of the phosphate from detergents present in waste water, except where speciﬁc phosphate-stripping units are used. The larg-est amount of phosphate in river systems is normally attached to particles of sediment. Rodda et al. (1999) report maximum dissolved reactive phosphorus levels of 0.2 mg/l but total phosphorus levels of 1.6 mg/l. This is for intensive dairy production, where the majority of phosphate is from agricultural fertilisers.Phosphates are a major contributor to eutrophi-cation problems. The fact that they are bound to sediments means that they often stay in a river sys-tem for a long period of time. Improvements in water quality for a river can often be delayed sub-stantially by the steady release of phosphate from sediments on the river bed.ChlorineChlorine is not normally found in river water. It is used as a disinfectant in the supply of drinking WATER QUALITY221adjacent. Adjacent land use may have some inﬂu-ence on the water quality of a sample, but this will be in addition to any affect from land uses further upstream which may be more signiﬁcant.Gravimetric methodsGravimetric analysis depends on the weighing of solids obtained from a sample by evaporation, ﬁl-tration or precipitation (or a combination of these three). This requires an extremely accurate weigh-ing balance and a drying oven, hence it is a labora-tory technique rather than a ﬁeld one. An example of gravimetric analysis is the standard method for measuring total dissolved solids (TDS). This is to ﬁlter a known volume of ﬁlter paper. The sample of water is then dried at 105 °C and the weight of residue left is the TDS.Other examples of gravimetric analysis are total suspended solids and sulphates (causing a precipi-tate and then weighing it).Volumetric methodsVolumetric analysis is using titration techniques to ﬁnd concentrations of designated substances. It is dependent on measuring the volume of a liquid reagent (of known concentration) that causes a vis-ible chemical reaction. This is another laboratory technique as it requires accurate measurements of volume using pipettes and burettes. Examples of this technique are chloride and dissolved oxygen (using the Winkler method).ColorimetryColorimetric analysis depends on a reagent caus-ing a colour to be formed when reacting with the particular ion you are interested in measuring. The strength of colour produced is assumed to be proportional to the concentration of the ion being measured (Beer’s law). The strength of colour can then be assessed using one of four techniques: comparison tubes, colour discs, colorimeter or spectrophotometer.system) frequently shows high levels of copper from vehicle brake pads. When washed into a river system, particularly in summer storms, the cop-per levels can be extremely high and cause toxicity problems to aquatic fauna.WATER-QUALITY MEASUREMENTThe techniques used for water-quality analysis vary considerably depending on equipment available and the accuracy of measurement required. For the highest accuracy of measurement, water samples should be taken back to a laboratory, but this is not always feasible. There are methods that can be carried out in the ﬁeld to gain a rapid assess-ment of water quality. Both ﬁeld and laboratory techniques are discussed on the following pages. Before discussing the measurement techniques it is important to consider how to sample for water quality.Sampling methodologyIt is difﬁcult to be speciﬁc on how frequently a water sample should be taken, or how many sam-ples represent a given stretch of water. The best way of ﬁnding this out is to take as many mea-surements as possible in a trial run. Then statisti-cal analyses can be carried out to see how much difference it would have made to have had fewer measurements. By working backwards from a large data set it is possible to deduce how few measure-ments can be taken while still maintaining some accuracy of overall assessment. An example of this type of approach, when used for the reduction in a hydrometry (water quantity) network, is in Pearson (1998). The main concern is that there are enough measurements to capture the temporal variability present and that the sample site is adequately rep-resentative of your river stretch.One important consideration that needs to be understood is that the sample of water taken at a particular site is representative of all the catch-ment above it, not just the land use immediately 222WATER QUALITYmeasure the electrical potential produced between two reactive substances. The tip of the electrode in the instrument has to be coated with a substance that reacts with the selected ion. With time the reactive ability of the electrode will decrease and need to be replaced. Although convenient for ﬁeld usage and accurate, the constant need for replacing electrodes makes these an expensive item to main-tain. There are ion-selective electrodes available to measure dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, cal-cium, chloride and others.Spectral techniquesWhen ions are energised by passing electricity through them, or in a ﬂame, they produce dis-tinctive colours. For instance, sodium produces a distinctive yellow colour, as evidenced by sodium lamps used in some cars and street lamps. Using spectral analysis techniques, the light intensity of particular ions in a ﬂame are measured and com-pared to the light intensity from known standard solutions. The most common form of this analysis is atomic absorption spectrophotometry, a laboratory technique which is mostly used for metallic ions.PROXY MEASURES OF WATER QUALITYAny measurement of water quality using individual parameters is vulnerable to the accusation that it represents one particular point of time but not the overall water quality. It is often more sensible to try and assess water quality through indirect measure-ment of something else that we know is inﬂuenced by water quality. Two such proxy measures of water quality are provided by biological indicators and analysis of sediments in the river.Biological indicatorsAquatic fauna normally remain within a stretch of water and have to try and tolerate whatever water pollution may be present. Consequently the health of aquatic fauna gives a very good indication of the Comparison tubes are prepared by using standard solutions of the ion under investigation which the reagent is added to. By having a range of standard solutions the strength of colour can be compared (by eye) to ﬁnd the concentration of the water sample. The standard solutions will fade with time and need remaking, hence this is a time-consuming method.Colour discs use the same principle as com-parison tubes, except in this case the standards are in the form of coloured glass or plastic ﬁlters. The coloured sample is visually compared to the coloured disc to ﬁnd the corresponding concentra-tion. It is possible to buy colour disc kits that come with small packets of reagent powder for assess-ment of a particular ion. This method is extremely convenient for rapid ﬁeld assessment, but is subjec-tive and prone to inaccuracy.A colorimeter (sometimes called an absorptiom-eter) takes the subjective element out of the assess-ment. It is similar to a turbidity meter in that a beam of light is shone through the reagent in a test tube. The amount of light emerging from the other side is detected by a photo-electric cell. The darker the solution (caused by a high concentration of reactive ion) the less light emerges. This reading can then be compared against calibrations done for standard solutions.A spectrophotometer is the most sophisticated form of colorimetric assessment. In this case instead of a beam of white light being shone through the sample (as for the colorimeter) a speciﬁc wavelength of light is chosen. The wavelength chosen will depend on the colour generated by the reagent and is speciﬁed by the reagent’s manufacturer.There are a range of spectrophotometers available to perform rapid analysis of water quality in either a laboratory or ﬁeld situation. Many ions of inter-est in water-quality analysis can be assessed using colorimetric analysis. These include nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and phosphate.Ion-selective electrodesIn a similar vein to pH meters, ion-selective electrodes detect particular ions in solution and WATER QUALITY223are easy to detect, while viruses and other patho-gens are extremely difﬁcult to measure. Coliform bacteria (i.e. bacteria of the intestine) are detected by their ability to ferment lactose, producing acid and gas (Tebbutt 1993). There are speciﬁc tests to grow E. coli in a lactose medium, which allow the tester to derive the most probable number per 100 ml (MPN/100 ml).SedimentsThe water in a channel is not the only part of a river that may be affected by water pollution. There are many substances that can build up in the sediments at the bottom of a river and provide a record of pol-lution. There are two big advantages to this method for investigating water quality: the sediments will reﬂect both instantaneous large pollution events and long, slow contamination at low levels; and if the river is particularly calm in a certain location the sediment provides a record of pollution with time (i.e. depth equals time). Not all water pollut-ants will stay in sediments, but some are particu-larly well suited to study in this manner (e.g. heavy metals and phosphorus).The interpretation of results is made difﬁcult by the mobility of some pollutants within sediments. Some metals will bind very strongly to clay parti-cles in the sediments (e.g. lead and copper), and you can be fairly certain that their position is indicative of where they were deposited. Others will readily disassociate from the particles and move around in the interstitial water (e.g. zinc and cadmium) (Allo-way and Ayres 1997). In this case you cannot be sure that a particularly high reading at one depth is from deposition at any particular time.MODELLING WATER QUALITYThe numerical modelling of water quality is fre-quently required, particularly to investigate the effects of particular water-quality scenarios. The type of problems investigated by modelling are: the impact of certain levels of waste discharge on a river (particularly under low ﬂow levels); recovery water quality through a reasonable period of time. There are two different ways that this can be done: catching fauna and assessing their health; or look-ing for the presence and absence of key indicator species.Fish surveys are a common method used for assessing the overall water quality in a river. It is an expensive ﬁeld technique as it requires substan-tial human resources: people to wade through the water with electric stun guns and then weigh and measure stunned ﬁsh. When this is done regularly it gives very good background information on the overall water quality of a river.More common are biological surveys using indi-cator species, particularly of macro-invertebrates. Kick sampling uses this technique. A bottom-based net is kicked into sediment to catch any bottom-based macro-invertebrates, which are then counted and identiﬁed. There are numerous meth-ods that can be used to collate this species informa-tion. In Britain the BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) score is commonly used and pro-vides good results. Species are given a score ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 representing species that are extremely intolerant to pollution. The presence of any species is scored (it is purely presence/absence, not the total number) and the total for the kick sample calculated. The BMWP score has a maxi-mum of 250. Other indicator species scores include the Chandler index and the ASPT (Average Score Per Taxon). Details of these can be found in a more detailed water-quality assessment text such as Chapman (1996).Another example of an indicator species used for water-quality testing is Escherichia coli (E. coli). These are used to indicate the presence or absence of faecal contamination in water. E. coli is a bacte-ria present in the intestines of all mammals and excreted in large numbers in faeces. Although one particular strain (E. coli157) has toxic side effects, the vast majority of E. coli are harmless to humans. Their presence in a water sample is indicative of fae-cal pollution, which may be dangerous because of other pathogens carried in the contaminated water. They are used as an indicator species because they 224WATER QUALITYThe major nutrients that restrict the extent of a plant’s growth are potassium (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). If you buy common fertiliser for a garden you will normally see the N:P:K ratio expressed to indicate the strength of the fertiliser. For both aquatic and terrestrial plants nitrogen is required for the production of chlorophyll and green leaves, while potassium and phosphorus are needed for root and stem growth. In the presence of abundant nitrogen and phosphorus (common water pollutants, see pp. 218–220), aquatic plant growth, including algae, will increase dramatically. This can be seen as positive as it is one way of removing the nitrate and phosphate from the water, but overall it has a negative impact on the river system. The main negative effect is a depletion of dissolved oxy-gen caused by bacteria decomposing dead vegeta-tive matter in the river. In temperate regions this is a particular problem in the autumn when the aquatic vegetation naturally dies back. In tropical regions it is a continual problem. A second nega-tive effect is from algal blooms. In 1989 there was an explosion in numbers of cyanobacteria in Rut-land Water, a reservoir supplying drinking water in central England (Howard 1994). (NB These are also called blue-green algae, despite being a phy-lum of bacteria.) Cyanobacteria produce toxins as waste products of respiration that can severely affect water quality. In the 1989 outbreak several dogs and sheep that drank water from Rutland Water were poisoned, although no humans were affected (Howard, 1994). In an effort to eliminate future problems, the nutrient-rich source water for Rut-land Water is supplemented with water from purer river water pumped from further aﬁeld.Eutrophication of water can occur at what appear to be very low nutrient levels. As an example the drinking water standard for nitrate-nitrogen is around 12 mg/l (depending on country) but con-centrations as low as 2–3 mg/l can cause eutrophi-cation problems in water bodies.Table 10.5 shows some of the indicators used in a quantitative example of deﬁned trophic lev-els developed for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The of a water body after a pollution event; the role of backwaters for concentration of pollutants in a river; and many more. The simplest water- quality models look at the concentration of a certain pollutant in a river given knowledge about ﬂow conditions and decay rates of the pollutant. The degradation of a pollutant with time can be simu-lated as a simple exponential decay rate equation. A simple mass balance approach can then be used to calculate the amount of pollutant left in the river after a given period of time (James 1993). More complex models build on this approach and incorporate ideas of diffusion, critical loads of pol-lutants and chemical reaction between pollutants in a river system. If the problem being researched is to track pollutants down a river then it is neces-sary to incorporate two- or three-dimensional rep-resentation of ﬂow hydraulics. There are numerous water-quality models available in the research lit-erature, as well as those used by consultants and water managers.EUTROPHICATION‘Eutrophication’ is the term used to describe the addition of nutrients to an aquatic ecosystem that leads to an increase in net primary productivity. The term comes from limnology (the study of freshwater bodies, e.g. lakes and ponds) and is part of an overall classiﬁcation system for the nutrition, or trophic, level of a freshwater body. The general classiﬁcation moves from oligotrophic (literally ‘few nutrients’), to eutrophic (‘good nutrition’) and ends with hypertrophic (‘excess nutrients’). In lim-nology this classiﬁcation is viewed as part of a natu-ral progression for bodies of water as they ﬁll up with sediment and plant matter. Eutrophication is a natural process (as part of the nitrogen and phos-phorus cycles), but it is the addition of extra nutri-ents from anthropogenic activity that attracts the main concern in hydrology. In order to distinguish between natural and human-induced processes the term ‘cultural eutrophication’ is sometimes used to identify the latter.WATER QUALITY225There are two major objectives for successful sewage treatment: to control the spread of disease from waste products and to break down the organic waste products into relatively harmless metabolites (i.e. by-products of metabolism by bacteria, etc.). The ﬁrst objective is achieved by isolating the waste away from animal hosts so that viruses and other pathogens die. The second objective is particularly important for the protection of where the treated efﬂuent ends up – frequently a river environment.In Britain the ﬁrst attempt to give guidelines for standards of sewage efﬂuent discharge were provided by the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal which sat between 1898 and 1915. The guidelines are based on two water-quality param-eters described earlier in this chapter: suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The Royal Commission set the so-called 30:20 standard which is still applicable today (i.e. 30 mg/l of sus-pended solids and 20 mg/l of BOD). The standard was based on a dilution ratio of 8:1 with river water. Where river ﬂow is greater than eight times the amount of sewage efﬂuent discharge the efﬂuent should have a TSS of less than 30 mg/l and a BOD of less than 20 mg/l. There was also the recommen-dation that if the river is used for drinking water extraction further downstream the standard should be tightened to 10:10. This was used as a recom-mendation until the 1970s when a system of legal consents to discharge was introduced (see p. 228).The processes operating at a waste water treat-ment works are very simple. They are summarised below and in Figure 10.6 (NB not every sewage treatment works will have all of these processes present).1 Primary treatment: screening and initial settlement.2 Secondary treatment: encouraging the biologi-cal breakdown of waste and settling out of remaining solids. This can take place either in trickle bed ﬁlters or activated sludge tanks. The main requirement is plenty of oxygen to allow micro-organisms to break down the concen-trated efﬂuent.chlorophyll is an indicator of algal growth in the water, while phosphorus and dissolved oxygen are more traditional water quality measures. The dis-solved oxygen is taken from the bottom of the lake because this is where vegetative decomposition is taking place. The dissolved oxygen level near to the surface will vary more because of the proximity to the water/air interface and the oxygen produced in photosynthesis by aquatic plants. It is worth noting that heavily eutrophied water samples will some-times have a dissolved oxygen greater than 100 per cent. This is due to the oxygen being produced by algae which can supersaturate the water.CONTROLLING WATER QUALITYWaste water treatmentThe treatment of waste water is a relatively simple process that mimics natural processes in a con-trolled, unnatural environment. The treatment pro-cesses used for industrial waste water are dependent on the type of waste being produced. In this section the processes described are those generally found in sewage treatment rather than in specialised indus-trial waste water treatment.Table 10.5 OECD classiﬁcation of lakes and res-ervoirs for temperate climatesTrophic levelAverage total P (mg/l)Dissolved oxygen (% saturation)Max. chlorophyll (mg/l) (at depth)Ultra-oligotrophic0.004>900.0025Oligotrophic0.01>800.008Mesotrophic0.01–0.03540–890.008–0.025Eutrophic0.035–0.10–400.025–0.075Hypertrophic>0.10–10>0.075Source: Adapted from Meybeck et al.

This is a re-creation of natural wetlands that have been shown to be extremely efﬁcient removers of both nitrogen and phosphorus from streams (e.g. Russel and Maltby 1995). Other methods of phosphate removal are to add a lime or metallic salt coagulant that causes a chemical 3 Tertiary treatment: biodigestion of sludge (from earlier settling treatment); extra treatment of dis-charging efﬂuent to meet water-quality standards (e.g. phosphate stripping, nitrate reduction).Raw sewage entering a sewage treatment works is approximately 99.9 per cent water (Gray 1999). This is derived from water used in washing and toilet ﬂushing, and also from storm runoff in an urban environment where there is a combined sewage/stormwater drainage scheme. Of the solids involved, the majority are organic and about half are dissolved in the water (TDS). Of the organic compounds the breakdown is approximately 65 per cent nitrogenous (proteins and urea), 25 per cent carbohydrates (sugars, starches, cel-lulose) and 10 per cent fats (cooking oils, grease, soaps) (Gray 1999). Typical values for TSS and BOD at different stages of sewage treatment are provided in Table 10.6.In tertiary treatment an effort is sometimes (but not always) made to reduce the level of nitrate and phosphorus in the discharged waste. In some cases this is achieved through ﬁnal settling ponds where the growth of aquatic ﬂora is encouraged and the nutrients are taken up by the plants before

Another safer form of disinfection is to use ultraviolet light, although this can be expensive to install and maintain.Source controlThe best way of controlling any pollution is to try and prevent it happening in the ﬁrst place. In order to achieve this differentiation has to be made between point source and diffuse pollutants (see p. 211). When control over the source of pollutants is achieved,  dramatic improvements in river-water quality can be achieved. An example of this is shown in the Case Study of the Nashua River in Massachusetts, USA.reaction with the dissolved phosphorus so that an insoluble form of phosphate settles out. This is particularly useful where the receiving water for the ﬁnal efﬂuent has problems with eutrophica-tion. The average phosphorus concentration in raw sewage is 5–20 mg/l, of which only 1–2 mg/l is removed in biological treatment.In some cases, particularly in the USA, chlori-nation of the discharging efﬂuent can take place. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to kill any patho-gens left after sewage treatment. This is a noble aim but creates its own difﬁculties. The chlorine can attach to organic matter left in the efﬂuent and create far worse substances such as polychlorinated Case studyCONTROLLING WATER QUALITY OF THE NASHUA RIVERThe Nashua river is an aquatic ecosystem that has undergone remarkable change in the last 100 years. It drains an area of approximately 1,400 km2 in the state of Massachusetts, USA, and is a tributary of the much larger Merrimack river which eventually ﬂows into the sea in Bos-ton Harbor (see Figure 10.7). The land use of the Nashua catchment is predominantly forest and agricultural, with a series of towns along the river. It is the industry associated with these towns that has brought about the changes in the Nashua, pre-dominantly through the twentieth century. The latter-day changes are well illustrated by the two photographs at the same stretch of the Nashua, in 1965 and 1995 (see Figures 10.8 and 10.9).Prior to European colonisation of North Amer-ica the Nashua valley was home to the Nashaway tribe, and the Nashua river could be considered to be in a pristine condition. With the arrival of European settlers to New England the area was used for agriculture and the saw milling of the extensive forests. The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century brought manufacturing to the area and mills sprang up along the river. By the middle of the twentieth century the small towns along the Nashua (Gardner, Fitchburg, Leomin-ster and Nashua) were home to paper, textile 
Figure 10.7 Location of the Nashua catchment in north-east USA.228WATER QUALITYand shoe factories, many of which were extract-ing water from the river and then discharging untreated waste back into the river. The pho-tograph of the Nashua in 1965 (Figure 10.8) is indicative of the pollution problems experienced in the river; in this case dye from a local paper factory has turned the river red. Under the US water-quality classiﬁcation scheme the river was classiﬁed as U: unﬁt to receive further sewage.In 1965 the Nashua River Clean-Up Com-mittee was set up to try to instigate a plan of restoring the water quality in the river. This com-mittee later became the Nashua River Watershed Association (NRWA) which still works today to improve water-quality standards in the area. Between 1972 and 1991, 11 waste water treat-ment plants were constructed or upgraded to treat waste from domestic, and to a lesser extent from industrial, sources in the catchment. These were built using grants from the state and fed-eral government as part of a strategy to improve the river from U to B status (ﬁt for ﬁshing and swimming). Through this control of point source pollution, the river-water quality has improved dramatically as can be seen in the second pho-tograph of the river (Figure 10.9). The river has attained B status and is an important recre-ational asset for the region. It has not returned to a pristine state, though, and is unlikely to while there is still a signiﬁcant urban popula-tion in the catchment. There are problems with combined sewage and stormwater drainage sys-tems discharging untreated waste into the river during large storms, and also diffuse pollution sources – particularly in the urban environment. However, during the latter half of the twentieth century the Nashua river has had its water qual-ity transformed from an abiotic sewer into a clean river capable of maintaining a healthy salmonid ﬁsh population. This has largely been achieved through the control of point pollution sources.The authors gratefully acknowledge the Nashua River Watershed Association for supplying much of this information and Figures 10.8 and 10.9.

WATER QUALITY229Controlling point source pollutantsThe control of point source pollutants can-not always be achieved by removing that point source. It is part of water resource management to recognise that there may be valid reasons for the disposal of waste in a river; effective man-agement ensures that waste disposal creates no harmful side effects. In the United Kingdom the control of point source pollution is through discharge consents. These provide a legal limit for worst-case scenarios – for example, at individual sewage treatment works they are usually set with respect to TSS, BOD and ammonia (sometimes heavy metals are included), and calculated to allow for low ﬂow levels in the receiving stream (see the technique box below for calculating dis-charge consents). There is also an obligation to comply with the European Union Urban Waste Water directive.In England, the setting of discharge consents for point source pollution control is carried out by the Environment Agency. A discharge consent gives a company the right to dispose of a certain amount of liquid waste into a river system so long as the pollution levels within the discharge are below certain levels. To calculate what those criti-cal levels are, a series of computer programs are used. These computer programs are in the public domain and can be obtained from the Environ-ment Agency. They use very simple principles that are described here.The main part of the discharge consent cal-culation concentrates on a simple mass balance equation:CQCQCQQDUUEEBE=++ (10.3)Where Q refers to the amount of ﬂow (m3/s) and C the concentration of pollutant. For the sub-scripts: D is for downstream; U is for upstream (i.e. the background); and E is for the efﬂuent.With this mass balance equation, the down-stream concentration can be calculated with varying ﬂows and levels of efﬂuent concentra-tions. This variation in ﬂow and concentration is achieved through a computer program running a Monte Carlo simulation.In this case the Monte Carlo simulation involves a random series of values for QU, QE, CU and CE drawn from an assumed distribution for each variable. It is assumed that the distribu-tions are log-normal in shape (see Figure 10.10) and therefore using the data in Table 10.7 the actual distribution for each variable is simulated. Once the distribution for each variable is known then a random variable is chosen from that dis-tribution. In the case of a log-normal distribu-tion this means that it is most likely to be close to the mean value but more likely to be above than below the mean (see Figure 10.10). In a Monte Carlo simulation the value of CD is cal-culated many times (often set to 1,000) so that a distribution for CD can be drawn. The consent to discharge ﬁgure is taken from the distribution of CD, usually looking at the 90 or 95 percentile Technique: Calculating discharge consents

River ﬂow data can be derived from a ﬂow duration curve (see Chapter 9). The water quality infor-mation requires at least 3 to 4 years of regular measurements. The values to describe QE and CE will either be known or are to be varied in the simulation in order to derive a consent to discharge value.In short, the person calculating the discharge consent inserts values from Table 10.7 into the Monte Carlo simulation. This will then produce the 95 percentile value of CD. If that value is too high (i.e. too much pollution) then the simula-tion is run again using lower values for CE until a reasonable value is derived. Once the reason-able value has been reached then the 95 percentile value of CE is taken as the discharge consent. The deﬁnition of a ‘reasonable value’ will be depen-dent on the designated use of the river. Rivers with high-class ﬁsheries and those with abstrac-tion for potable supply have much higher stan-dards than for other uses.The approach described here can be used to calculate a consent to discharge for such water quality parameters as BOD and TSS. When a cal-culation is being carried out for ammonia then more data are required to describe the water qual-ity in the receiving river. Parameters such as pH, temperature, alkalinity, TDS and dissolved oxy-gen (all described with mean and standard devia-tion values) are required so that chemical reaction rates within the river can be calculated.A scheme such as discharge consents provides a legal framework for the control of point source pol-lutants but the actual control comes about through implementing improved waste water treatment.loading comes during long, dry periods which may be broken by ﬂushes of high rainfall (e.g. sum-mer months in temperate regions). In this case the majority of pollutants reach the stream in the ﬁrst ﬂush of runoff. If this runoff can be captured and held then the impact of these diffuse pollutants is lessened. This is common practice for motorway runoff where it drains into a holding pond before moving into a nearby water course.Another management tool for control of diffuse pollutants is to place restrictions on land manage-ment practices. An example of this is in areas of England that have been designated either a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) or a Nitrate Sensitive Area (NSA), predominantly through fears of nitrate con-tamination in aquifers. In NSAs the agricultural Controlling diffuse source pollutantsThe control of diffuse source water pollution is much harder to achieve. In an urban environ-ment this can be achieved through the collection of stormwater drainage into artiﬁcial wetlands where natural processes can lessen the impact of the pollutants on the draining stream. Of particular concern is runoff derived from road surfaces where many pollutants are present as waste products from vehicles. Hamilton and Harrison (1991) suggest that although roads only make up 5–8 per cent of an urban catchment area they can contribute up to 50 per cent of the TSS, 50 per cent of the total hydrocarbons and 75 per cent of the total heavy metals input into a stream. The highest pollutant WATER QUALITY231(after August 1986) (Biggs 1989). (NB the vertical axis is on a logarithmic scale so differences appear smaller.) A remarkable point about this study is how quickly the river appears to have recovered (approximately 5 months) following treatment of the point source pollution. This is a reﬂection of the low residence time of the pollutants within the river system and the effective ﬂushing out of the pollutants by the river.Dodds (2002) presents two case studies on lake eutrophication with varying degrees of success. The ﬁrst is for Lake Washington on the eastern border of Seattle, USA. For Lake Washington the diversion of treated sewage away from the lake (achieved in 1963) was enough to halt the decline in water quality and return the lake to an oligo-trophic state. For Lake Trummen in Sweden the stopping of sewage input into the lake was not enough to improve water quality since high lev-els of phosphorous remained in the lake sediment continuing the eutrophication problem. In this case a dramatic rise in water quality was achieved by dredging the lake sediments (and selling the dredged sediments as nutrient topsoil) so that the lake was able to be returned to recreational usage (Dodds 2002).In New Zealand there is an ongoing study to improve the water quality in Lake Rotorua in the Central North Island. This is a lake of tremen-dous importance for tourism and of great cultural importance to the local Maori people. Initially it was thought that the water quality problem could be solved through treating the point source pol-lution at a sewage treatment plant which received a signiﬁcant upgrade in 1990. Although this caused a temporary decrease in nutrient loading to the lake the water quality has continued to decline, largely due to agricultural intensiﬁca-tion in the lake catchment area. Nitrate-nitrogen levels in the streams feeding into the lake are in the order of 1–2 mg/l but have increased signiﬁ-cantly over the past 30 years (White et al. 2007). A major concern is that the groundwater levels of nitrate-nitrogen are higher than this, effectively delaying the movement of nutrient to the lake practices of muck spreading and fertilising with nitrates are heavily restricted. This type of con-trol relies on tight implementation of land use  planning – something that is not found uniformly between countries, or even within countries.Examples of controlling water pollutionBiggs (1989) presents data showing the recov-ery of a river in New Zealand following effective treatment of a point source pollution problem. The pollution was due to discharge of untreated efﬂuent from an abattoir, directly into a nearby branch of the Waimakariri river. Water quality was monitored upstream and downstream of the discharge point before and after a staged improve-ment in wastewater treatment at the abattoir. The results shown in Figure 10.11 use an auto-trophic index, a ratio of the periphyton mass to  chlorophyll-a. This is a measure of the proportions of heterotrophic (require organic carbon to sur-vive) to autotrophic (produce organic compounds from simple molecules) organisms. The time series of data upstream and downstream from the abat-toir (Figure 10.11) can be split between the pre-treatment period (Sep–Oct 1985), the recovery period (May–Aug 1986) and the recovered period

10,"We live in a world that is constantly adjusting to change. This applies from the natural, through to the economic world and is fundamental to the way that we live our lives. The theory of evolu-tion proposes that in order to survive, each species on the planet is changing over a long time period (through natural selection) in order to adapt to its ecosystem fully. Equally, economists would say that people and businesses need to adapt and change to stay competitive in a global economy. If, as was argued in the introductory chapter of this book, water is fundamental to all elements of our life on this planet, then we would expect to see hydrology constantly changing to keep up with our changing world. It is perhaps no great surprise to say that hydrology has, and is, changing – but not in all areas. The principle of uniformitarianism states in its most elegant form: ‘the present is the key to the past’. Equally, it could be said that the present is the key to the future and we can recognise this with respect to the fundamentals of hydrology. By the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century people may be liv-ing in a different climate from now, their economic lives may be unlike ours, and almost certainly their knowledge of hydrological processes will be greater than at present. However, the hydrological processes will still be operating in the same man-ner, although maybe at differing rates to those that we measure today. Koutsoyiannis (2013) points out that hydrology has developed as a science through understanding change at different timescales but that humans can never fully control that change LEARNING OBJECTIVESWhen you have ﬁnished reading this chapter you should have: /H17039An understanding of water resource management. /H17039An understanding of the main issues of change that affect hydrology. /H17039An understanding of how hydrological investigations are carried out to look at issues of change. /H17039A knowledge of the research literature and main ﬁndings in the issues of change. /H17039A knowledge of case studies looking at change in different regions of the world.11WATER RESOURCES IN A CHANGING WORLD234WATER RESOURCES IN A CHANGING WORLDprovision, therefore water resource management is a very real proposition. If we are going to manage the water environment is it purely for consumption or are there other uses that need protection and man-agement? Over the past hundred years there has been a large-scale rise in the amount of time peo-ple in the western world spend at leisure. Leisure activities include sports such as ﬁshing, canoeing and boating, all of which require clean, fully ﬂow-ing rivers. Thought is now given to the amenity value of rivers and lakes (i.e. how useful they are as places of pleasure without necessarily providing a direct economic return). Management of the water environment needs to be designed to maintain and enhance amenity values. Equally we have an obli-gation to protect the water environment for future generations and for other species that co-exist with the water. Therefore water resource management needs to embrace sustainable development in its good practices. It is clear that water resource man-agement has to embrace all of these issues and at the same time adapt to changing views on what is required of water management.Almost all of the processes found in the hydro-logical cycle can be manipulated in some way. Table 11.1 sets out some of these interventions and the implications of their being dealt with by those involved in water resource management. It is immediately apparent from Table 11.1 that the issues go far beyond the river boundary. For example, land use change has a huge importance for water resource management, so that any deci-sions on land use need to include consultation with water resource managers. It is important that a legislative framework is in place for countries so that this consultation does take place. Likewise for other areas where human intervention may have a signiﬁcant impact on water resources. The issue of ﬁnding the correct management structures and leg-islation is investigated in the Case Study looking at how water resources have been managed in England (see pp. 235–238). The changing world in this case has been through increasing population pressures, but probably more importantly is an adaptation to changing political beliefs.and therefore change and uncertainty are key com-ponents for us to understand for the future.The early chapters of this book have been con-cerned with hydrological processes and our assess-ment of them. Our knowledge of the processes will improve, and our methods of measurement and esti-mation will get better, but the fundamentals will still be the same. In this ﬁnal chapter several hydro-logical issues are explored with respect to managing water resources and change that might be expected. The issue of change is explored in a water resource management context: how we respond to changes in patterns of consumption; increasing population pressure and possible changes in climate. The top-ics discussed here are not exhaustive in covering all issues of change that might be expected in the near future, but they do reﬂect some of the major concerns. It is meant as an introduction to issues of change and how they affect hydrology; other books and articles cover some of these issues in far more depth (e.g. McDonald and Kay 1988; Acreman 2000; Arnell 2002; Koutsoyiannis 2013). The ﬁrst broad topic of discussion is water resource man-agement, particularly at the local scale. The second topic is the one that dominates the research litera-ture in natural sciences at present: climate change. The third and fourth topics are concerned with the way we treat our environment and the effect this has on water resources: land use change and groundwa-ter depletion. The ﬁnal topic is urban hydrology –  of great concern, with an ever-increasing urban population all around the world.WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENTWhen the topic of water resource management is discussed it is often difﬁcult to pinpoint exactly what authors mean by the term. Is it concerned with all aspects of the hydrological cycle or only with those of direct concern to humans, particularly water consumption? As soon as the term ‘resource’ is introduced then it automatically implies a human dimension. Water is a resource because we need it, and there are ways that we can manipulate its "
